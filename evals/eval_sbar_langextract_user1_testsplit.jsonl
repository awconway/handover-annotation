{"example":{"text":"[PHARMACIST]: Hi Dr. Lee, I wanted to speak with you about Mr. James Carter, who\u2019s being discharged today. He\u2019s being started on warfarin for atrial fibrillation post-op, and I\u2019m organising his discharge medications and follow-up.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. What\u2019s the current plan?\n[PHARMACIST]: He\u2019s had two doses of warfarin so far\u20145 mg on Day 1 and 3 mg yesterday. His INR this morning was 1.6, so still subtherapeutic. I\u2019ve charted 3 mg again today, and we\u2019ll need to arrange ongoing INR monitoring through his GP or local pathology service.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay. Has the GP been contacted?\n[PHARMACIST]: Not yet. I was going to ask if you\u2019d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2\u20133 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I\u2019ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork.

Any other meds to note?\n[PHARMACIST]: He\u2019s also on, Metoprolol 25 mg BD, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Paracetamol PRN, No known drug allergies.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect. I\u2019ll finalise the discharge summary and include the INR plan. Thanks for organising everything.\n[PHARMACIST]: No problem.
