A catheter was inserted last night, but over the last few hours he seems to have become more lethargic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. His urine output\u2019s dropped quite a bit \u2014 not sure if the catheter\u2019s blocked or if he\u2019s just shutting down.\n[DOCTOR]: What are his current vitals?\n[NURSE]: BP\u2019s sitting around 88/54, HR about 112, RR 22, SpO\u2082 96% on room air, temp 37.9\u00b0C. He\u2019s only passed about 40 mL in the last three hours, give or take.
