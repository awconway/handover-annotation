He’s being started on warfarin for atrial fibrillation post-op, and I’m organising his discharge medications and follow-up.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. What’s the current plan?\n[PHARMACIST]: He’s had two doses of warfarin so far—5 mg on Day 1 and 3 mg yesterday. His INR this morning was 1.6, so still subtherapeutic. I’ve charted 3 mg again today, and we’ll need to arrange ongoing INR monitoring through his GP or local pathology service.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay. Has the GP been contacted?\n[PHARMACIST]: Not yet. I was going to ask if you’d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2–3 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I’ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork. Has he been counselled?\n[PHARMACIST]: Yes, I’ve spoken with him about, Dietary interactions (especially vitamin K), Bleeding risks, Signs to report (e.g. bruising, blood in urine/stool), Avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol, He’s aware and has agreed to follow up with his GP.\n[DOCTOR]: Great. Any other meds to note?\n[PHARMACIST]: He’s also on, Metoprolol 25 mg BD, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Paracetamol PRN, No known drug allergies.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect. I’ll finalise the discharge summary and include the INR plan. Thanks for organising everything.\n[PHARMACIST]: No problem.

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart. So, Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases — who I think will be the consultant covering this week. Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He’s currently being barrier nursed in isolation. Full PPE is required before entering — though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case. He’s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight — not sure how many. Managed with oral rehydration and IV fluids. No vomiting that I’m aware of. Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn’t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling “a little off” earlier. Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I’m not completely sure if they’ve been through yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Davies, how are you feeling this morning? Any nausea or cramping?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but no pain. Just still needing the bathroom a lot.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay, thanks. He’s aware of the need to remain in isolation and has mostly been cooperative with infection control steps. No visitors allowed at this stage, though I think his partner’s been trying to contact the ward. Dr. Kumar should be reviewing later today — I’m not sure of the exact time yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. I’ll keep monitoring his fluids, stool frequency, and general symptoms, and check in again after the review.

Is that okay?\n[PATIENT]: Sure, that’s fine.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Priya. This is Alexander Marek in Room 4, under Dr Gaylor. Alex, can you confirm your full name and date of birth for us?\n[PATIENT]: Alexander Marek, 12-09-58.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. Any allergies to medications?\n[PATIENT]: None that I know of.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay. So, Alex is 66 years old, admitted with acute on chronic renal failure. He’s on home haemodialysis normally.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He has a history of end-stage renal failure, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression. He also has atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Okay.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: We need his warfarin level today to guide dosing. ED drew bloods but missed the warfarin/INR, so that still needs to be taken and then please get the doctors to review the result.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll take the INR straight after handover and flag it with the team.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: His potassium this morning is 6.2, so very high. The doctors are aware and we’re waiting on their treatment orders. I’ve printed the hyperkalaemia protocol and left it just outside the notes if you need it.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks, I see it there. I’ll follow up for orders.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s for renal ultrasound and biopsy to be arranged by the renal team.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He's for daily weight and he’s 82 kilograms today.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: His Lying and standing blood pressures are stable—no postural drop.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: AV fistula observations are good: there’s a bruit and thrill present.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Blood glucose levels QID; latest BGL is 5.6.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Perfect. Alex, do you usually dialyze Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings?\n[PATIENT]: Yes, M-W-F in the mornings. I had dialysis yesterday.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: I’ve called the dialysis unit to let them know he’s admitted and needs scheduling while he’s here.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, I’ll coordinate with them for the next session.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Otherwise he’s stable at the moment.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Alex, anything you want to add or anything you need right now?\n[PATIENT]: No, I’m okay, thank you.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll draw your INR now, and chase the team for the hyperkalaemia orders, \n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Sounds good.

He’s currently stable but showing significant right-sided weakness and difficulty with coordination.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. What’s his current status?\n[NURSE]: He’s alert and orientated, GCS 15. Vitals are stable: BP: 142/86, HR: 78 bpm, RR: 16, Temp: 36.7°C, SpO?: 96% on room air, Q-ADDS score: 2 for (BP + mobility). He’s mobilising with assistance but has poor upper limb function on the right. He’s struggling with feeding and grooming tasks. I think he’d benefit from an occupational therapy referral to assess for functional support and equipment.\n[DOCTOR]: Any IV access?\n[NURSE]: Yes, he has a 20G cannula in his left forearm—patent and flushed. No IV fluids running currently.\n[DOCTOR]: What medications is he on?\n[NURSE]; He’s currently prescribed: Aspirin 100 mg daily, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Perindopril 4 mg daily, Paracetamol 1g QID PRN for comfort. No known drug allergies.\n[DOCTOR]: How is he positioned?\n[NURSE]: We’re using 30-degree lateral tilt positioning to offload pressure areas and support his hemiplegic side. He’s on a pressure-relieving mattress and being repositioned every 2 hours.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. I’ll review him and put in the OT referral.
