Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He\u2019s currently being barrier nursed in isolation.

He has a background of depression and possible early dementia and is now presenting with acute confusion and agitation.\n[ED NURSE]: What\u2019s been happening?\n[AMBULANCE OFFICER]: Over the past week he\u2019s become increasingly withdrawn, refusing meals, and expressing low mood.
