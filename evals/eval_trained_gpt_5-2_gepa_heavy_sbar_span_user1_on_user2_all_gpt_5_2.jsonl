[OUTGOING_NURSE]: And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart. So, Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases \u2014 who I think will be the consultant covering this week. Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He\u2019s currently being barrier nursed in isolation. Full PPE is required before entering \u2014 though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case. He\u2019s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight \u2014 not sure how many. Managed with oral rehydration and IV fluids. No vomiting that I\u2019m aware of. Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn\u2019t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca little off\u201d earlier.

This is Mr. Peter Thompson in Bed 6, Room 4, aged 78, under Dr. Ellis, General Medicine.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Mr. Thompson was brought into ED yesterday by his wife due to severe constipation and abdominal discomfort. He had not opened his bowels for 6 days and was experiencing bloating and reduced appetite. His wife, who is also elderly, was struggling to manage his care at home.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He was assessed in ED, given a fleet enema and started on oral laxatives. Abdominal X-ray showed significant faecal loading but no obstruction. He\u2019s now admitted for bowel management and monitoring. Vitals are stable. No nausea or vomiting overnight.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s had one small bowel motion early this morning. Pain score was 3/10. He\u2019s tolerating fluids and has been mobilising with assistance.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Thompson, how are you feeling this morning? Any relief after the bowel motion?\n[PATIENT]: A little better, still a bit uncomfortable.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s aware of the plan and has been cooperative. His wife is quite anxious and has asked to speak with someone about support at home. A social worker referral has been made to assess home care needs and carer support.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: I\u2019ll follow up with the social work team and check in with Dr. Ellis\u2019s team regarding next steps. Is there anything you need before we finish handover?\n[PATIENT]: No, I\u2019m okay.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Please use the call bell if you need anything. I\u2019ll leave you in good hands.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: I\u2019ll be back shortly to check your observations and review your chart, Mr. Thompson.","gold_spans":[{"start":442,"end":641,"token_start":110,"token_end":144,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":642,"end":715,"token_start":145,"token_end":161,"label":"BACKGROUND"},{"start":734,"end":984,"token_start":167,"token_end":214,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1003,"end":1139,"token_start":220,"token_end":246,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1206,"end":1240,"token_start":262,"token_end":268,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1252,"end":1295,"token_start":274,"token_end":282,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1314,"end":1362,"token_start":288,"token_end":298,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":1361,"end":1531,"token_start":298,"token_end":331,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":1550,"end":1647,"token_start":337,"token_end":357,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":1745,"end":1791,"token_start":384,"token_end":393,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":1840,"end":1909,"token_start":407,"token_end":419,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"}]},"prediction":{"pred_spans":[{"label":"SITUATION","quote":"Mr. Thompson was brought into ED yesterday by his wife due to severe constipation and abdominal discomfort."},{"label":"ASSESSMENT","quote":"He had not opened his bowels for 6 days and was experiencing bloating and reduced appetite."},{"label":"BACKGROUND","quote":"His wife, who is also elderly, was struggling to manage his care at home."},{"label":"ASSESSMENT","quote":"He was assessed in ED, given a fleet enema and started on oral laxatives.

{"example":{"text":"[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Good morning, Mr. Carter. I\u2019m Dr. Chen from City Thoracic Unit. I\u2019ll just get the handover from my colleague now, if that\u2019s alright.\n[PATIENT]: Yes, that\u2019s fine.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: This should be Bed 5, James Carter, 62 years old, under Dr. Singh \u2014 I believe he\u2019s the thoracic surgeon on today\u2019s roster. Mr. Carter was admitted yesterday after referral from oncology for surgical review of what appears to be a left upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma. He\u2019s had increasing shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month \u2014 he\u2019s not sure exactly when it started worsening. CT chest shows a 3.8 cm lesion with no definite mediastinal involvement, but margins are still being reviewed. The PET from last week shows localized uptake, though I think pathology hasn\u2019t correlated all the findings yet.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s currently haemodynamically stable. No haemoptysis or chest pain reported overnight. Oxygen sats are sitting around 96% on room air. Pain\u2019s been manageable with regular paracetamol. No major changes overnight, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca bit tighter\u201d this morning.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Hi Mr. Carter, can I just confirm your full name for me?\n[PATIENT]: James Carter.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, and I\u2019ll check your wristband\u2026 that matches. Are you having any pain or discomfort at the moment?\n[PATIENT]: Just some chest tightness, not bad though.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Vitals this morning roughly BP 132/78, HR 76, RR 18, Temp 36.9, SpO\u2082 96%. I\u2019ll double\u2011check the printed obs to be sure.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any allergies?\n[PATIENT]: No known allergies.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Okay, I\u2019ll confirm that in the chart. What about current medications?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s on regular paracetamol one gram QID, salbutamol inhaler as needed, pantoprazole 40 daily. No antibiotics at present \u2014 there was some discussion yesterday about prophylaxis, but decision pending surgical review. IV fluids were stopped overnight; he\u2019s nil by mouth while waiting for the team to confirm theatre timing, which I think will depend on bed availability and the PFT results.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any relevant medical history?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes \u2014 hypertension controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, former smoker, about a 30\u2011pack\u2011year history, no diabetes that I know of, and no previous thoracic surgery. Oncology mentioned possible mild COPD features, but that hasn\u2019t been formally diagnosed.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: So, plan is MDT review today for potential lobectomy or segmentectomy, is that right?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes, that\u2019s the plan as far as I know. Pulmonary function tests are pending \u2014 I think they were booked for this morning, but not entirely sure if they\u2019ve been collected yet. Bloods from yesterday were within normal limits \u2014 WCC 7.8, CRP 12, renal and liver fine, ECG normal sinus rhythm. No other outstanding investigations I\u2019m aware of.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, thanks. Mr. Carter, anything you need before we wrap up?\n[PATIENT]: No, I\u2019m okay. Just waiting to find out what\u2019s happening with surgery.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Perfect.

I had a seizure yesterday, and they said it was my first one.\n[NURSE]: He had a generalised tonic-clonic seizure yesterday morning. CT and EEG are pending, but neurology has started him on levetiracetam 500 mg BD. No IV access now\u2014he\u2019s on oral meds only. No known allergies.\n[PHARMACIST]: Thanks. Daniel, I\u2019ll go through how to take your medication, what side effects to watch for, and how to manage your day-to-day safely. Have you had a chance to read the medication leaflet?\n[PATIENT]: Not yet. I\u2019m still trying to take it all in.\n[PHARMACIST]: That\u2019s okay\u2014we\u2019ll take it step by step. Levetiracetam is taken twice a day, about 12 hours apart. It\u2019s important not to miss doses. Some people feel a bit tired or moody when they first start, but that usually settles. If you feel very low or notice any big changes in mood, let us know straight away.\n[NURSE]: He\u2019s also on a food and fluid chart while we monitor his intake\u2014he\u2019s been a bit nauseous since yesterday but is improving.\n[PHARMACIST]: Good to know. Daniel, you\u2019ll also need to avoid driving for now\u2014by law, you need to be seizure-free for a certain period before you can drive again. We\u2019ll give you written information about that too.\n[PATIENT]: Okay. I didn\u2019t realise that.\n[PHARMACIST]: Totally understandable.

{"example":{"text":"[DOCTOR]: Hi, I\u2019m handing over Mr. Amir Rahman, 63 years old, admitted yesterday with what looks like a large anterior MI \u2014 the ECG was fairly convincing.

Can you give me a quick overview?\n[DOCTOR]: Sure. He\u2019s still a bit haemodynamically shaky post\u2011MI, with ongoing low cardiac output. The IABP went in this morning via the femoral artery \u2014 I believe the cardiology registrar did it. It\u2019s set to 1:1 augmentation. So far, he seems to be responding \u2014 BP\u2019s come up a bit, and lactates look like they\u2019re trending down, though the last result isn\u2019t in yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any other lines or support?\n[DOCTOR]: Right, he\u2019s got an arterial line in the right radial for continuous BP monitoring, a central line in the right internal jugular, and an IDC in situ. I think he\u2019s also still connected to telemetry, but I\u2019ll need to double\u2011check if that\u2019s linked to the central monitoring unit. He\u2019s on low\u2011dose noradrenaline, sitting around 2 micrograms a minute, but that\u2019s fluctuated a little. IV heparin is running for balloon pump patency \u2014 pharmacy flagged a possible review of APTT later today.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any communication needs?\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, he\u2019s from a non\u2011English speaking background \u2014 Arabic\u2019s his first language. He understands basic English, but it\u2019s hit\u2011and\u2011miss for more complex instructions. Somebody requested an interpreter for the family conference, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s been booked yet.

He\u2019s anxious \u2014 understandably \u2014 so maybe consider whether some short\u2011acting anxiolytic\u2019s needed if he escalates later.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any allergies or medications?\n[DOCTOR]: No known drug allergies as far as documented. Meds include aspirin 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg nocte, the IV heparin infusion, noradrenaline, and the PRNs \u2014 paracetamol and oxycodone.
