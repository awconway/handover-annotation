{"example": {"text": "[NURSE]: Hi Dr. Patel, I need to escalate a concern about Mr. Thomas Nguyen, 74 years old, currently in bed 5 on the urology ward. He’s been deteriorating clinically — I’m not exactly sure what’s triggering it, but I think he needs a medical review soon, possibly urgently.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, what’s going on?\n[NURSE]: He was admitted yesterday with acute urinary retention and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A catheter was inserted last night, but over the last few hours he seems to have become more lethargic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. His urine output’s dropped quite a bit — not sure if the catheter’s blocked or if he’s just shutting down.\n[DOCTOR]: What are his current vitals?\n[NURSE]: BP’s sitting around 88/54, HR about 112, RR 22, SpO₂ 96% on room air, temp 37.9°C. He’s only passed about 40 mL in the last three hours, give or take. His Q‑ADDS is around 7, though I’ll double‑check — it might be 8 depending on the scoring for output.\n[DOCTOR]: Any pain or other symptoms?\n[NURSE]: He’s got some lower abdominal discomfort — says it’s “tight” more than painful — and a low‑grade fever. He’s a bit confused, which the team on shift earlier didn’t mention, so that’s new. No vomiting that I’ve seen, but he’s refusing fluids and looks a little clammy.\n[DOCTOR]: Any recent bloods?\n[NURSE]: Yes, this morning’s labs: white cell 14.6, CRP 98, creatinine 168 from 102 yesterday, eGFR down to 44 — sorry, I think it’s 44, not 4, but I can confirm. Looks like he might be heading into an acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to infection, obstruction, or both. Micro hasn’t come back yet, but urine looked cloudy.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, thanks. I’ll come and review him now — give me about ten minutes. We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction’s worsening. I’ll decide once I’ve seen him.\n[NURSE]: Alright, I’ll keep an eye on him for now and prepare in case you want to transfer or escalate further.", "gold_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 210, "token_start": 38, "token_end": 47, "label": "Unknown fact"}, {"start": 215, "end": 274, "token_start": 49, "token_end": 61, "label": "Hedging"}, {"start": 552, "end": 590, "token_start": 120, "token_end": 127, "label": "Vagueness"}, {"start": 591, "end": 658, "token_start": 128, "token_end": 143, "label": "Unknown fact"}, {"start": 858, "end": 959, "token_start": 202, "token_end": 223, "label": "Hedging"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1466, "token_start": 336, "token_end": 356, "label": "Hedging"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1581, "token_start": 357, "token_end": 378, "label": "Hedging"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1809, "token_start": 414, "token_end": 429, "label": "Hedging"}]}, "prediction": {"pred_spans": [{"label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "I’m not exactly sure what’s triggering it"}, {"label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "not sure if the catheter’s blocked or if he’s just shutting down"}, {"label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "though I’ll double‑check — it might be 8 depending on the scoring for output"}, {"label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "sorry, I think it’s 44, not 4, but I can confirm"}, {"label": "Procedural uncertainty", "quote": "We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction’s worsening"}], "span_metrics": {"precision": 0.3862828713574982, "recall": 0.24142679459843638, "f1": 0.29714067027499863, "tp": 1.931414356787491, "pred_count": 5, "gold_count": 8, "detailed": {"preds": [{"idx": 0, "label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "I’m not exactly sure what’s triggering it", "span": [168, 209]}, {"idx": 1, "label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "not sure if the catheter’s blocked or if he’s just shutting down", "span": [593, 657]}, {"idx": 2, "label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "though I’ll double‑check — it might be 8 depending on the scoring for output", "span": [882, 958]}, {"idx": 3, "label": "Unknown fact", "quote": "sorry, I think it’s 44, not 4, but I can confirm", "span": [1417, 1465]}, {"idx": 4, "label": "Procedural uncertainty", "quote": "We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction’s worsening", "span": [1717, 1809]}], "golds": [{"idx": 0, "label": "Unknown fact", "span": [168, 210]}, {"idx": 1, "label": "Hedging", "span": [215, 274]}, {"idx": 2, "label": "Vagueness", "span": [552, 590]}, {"idx": 3, "label": "Unknown fact", "span": [591, 658]}, {"idx": 4, "label": "Hedging", "span": [858, 959]}, {"idx": 5, "label": "Hedging", "span": [1399, 1466]}, {"idx": 6, "label": "Hedging", "span": [1467, 1581]}, {"idx": 7, "label": "Hedging", "span": [1717, 1809]}], "matches": [{"pred_idx": 0, "gold_idx": 0, "iou": 0.9761904761904762, "credit": 0.9761904761904762}, {"pred_idx": 1, "gold_idx": 3, "iou": 0.9552238805970149, "credit": 0.9552238805970149}]}}}, "score": 0.29714067027499863}

Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn’t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling “a little off” earlier. Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I’m not completely sure if they’ve been through yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Davies, how are you feeling this morning? Any nausea or cramping?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but no pain. Just still needing the bathroom a lot.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay, thanks. He’s aware of the need to remain in isolation and has mostly been cooperative with infection control steps. No visitors allowed at this stage, though I think his partner’s been trying to contact the ward. Dr. Kumar should be reviewing later today — I’m not sure of the exact time yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. I’ll keep monitoring his fluids, stool frequency, and general symptoms, and check in again after the review. If there’s any issue with supplies or isolation process, I’ll raise it with infection control.\n[PATIENT]: No problem.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Mr. Davies.

I had a seizure yesterday, and they said it was my first one.\n[NURSE]: He had a generalised tonic-clonic seizure yesterday morning. CT and EEG are pending, but neurology has started him on levetiracetam 500 mg BD. No IV access now—he’s on oral meds only. No known allergies.\n[PHARMACIST]: Thanks. Daniel, I’ll go through how to take your medication, what side effects to watch for, and how to manage your day-to-day safely. Have you had a chance to read the medication leaflet?\n[PATIENT]: Not yet. I’m still trying to take it all in.\n[PHARMACIST]: That’s okay—we’ll take it step by step. Levetiracetam is taken twice a day, about 12 hours apart. It’s important not to miss doses. Some people feel a bit tired or moody when they first start, but that usually settles. If you feel very low or notice any big changes in mood, let us know straight away.\n[NURSE]: He’s also on a food and fluid chart while we monitor his intake—he’s been a bit nauseous since yesterday but is improving.\n[PHARMACIST]: Good to know.

We’ll give you written information about that too.\n[PATIENT]: Okay. I didn’t realise that.\n[PHARMACIST]: Totally understandable. I’ll leave you with a medication info sheet and come back later to check if you have any questions.
