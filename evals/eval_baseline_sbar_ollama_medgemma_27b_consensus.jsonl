{"example":{"text":"[PHARMACIST]: Hi Dr. Lee, I wanted to speak with you about Mr. James Carter, who\u2019s being discharged today. He\u2019s being started on warfarin for atrial fibrillation post-op, and I\u2019m organising his discharge medications and follow-up.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. What\u2019s the current plan?\n[PHARMACIST]: He\u2019s had two doses of warfarin so far\u20145 mg on Day 1 and 3 mg yesterday. His INR this morning was 1.6, so still subtherapeutic. I\u2019ve charted 3 mg again today, and we\u2019ll need to arrange ongoing INR monitoring through his GP or local pathology service.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay. Has the GP been contacted?\n[PHARMACIST]: Not yet. I was going to ask if you\u2019d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2\u20133 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I\u2019ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork. Has he been counselled?\n[PHARMACIST]: Yes, I\u2019ve spoken with him about, Dietary interactions (especially vitamin K), Bleeding risks, Signs to report (e.g. bruising, blood in urine/stool), Avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol, He\u2019s aware and has agreed to follow up with his GP.\n[DOCTOR]: Great. Any other meds to note?\n[PHARMACIST]: He\u2019s also on, Metoprolol 25 mg BD, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Paracetamol PRN, No known drug allergies.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect. I\u2019ll finalise the discharge summary and include the INR plan. Thanks for organising everything.\n[PHARMACIST]: No problem.

{"example":{"text":"[INCOMING_NURSE]: Good morning, Mr. Davies. I\u2019m Jack, and I\u2019ll be your nurse for today. We\u2019ll just do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that\u2019s okay.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Hi, Mr. Davies. This is Emma the nurse taking over for the day. Could you please confirm your full name?\n[PATIENT]: Michael Davies.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thank you. And your date of birth? [PATIENT]: First July 1985. [OUTGOING_NURSE]: And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart. So, Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases \u2014 who I think will be the consultant covering this week. Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He\u2019s currently being barrier nursed in isolation. Full PPE is required before entering \u2014 though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case. He\u2019s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight \u2014 not sure how many. Managed with oral rehydration and IV fluids. No vomiting that I\u2019m aware of. Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn\u2019t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca little off\u201d earlier. Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I\u2019m not completely sure if they\u2019ve been through yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Davies, how are you feeling this morning? Any nausea or cramping?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but no pain. Just still needing the bathroom a lot.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay, thanks. He\u2019s aware of the need to remain in isolation and has mostly been cooperative with infection control steps. No visitors allowed at this stage, though I think his partner\u2019s been trying to contact the ward. Dr. Kumar should be reviewing later today \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of the exact time yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. I\u2019ll keep monitoring his fluids, stool frequency, and general symptoms, and check in again after the review. If there\u2019s any issue with supplies or isolation process, I\u2019ll raise it with infection control.\n[PATIENT]: No problem.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Mr. Davies.
