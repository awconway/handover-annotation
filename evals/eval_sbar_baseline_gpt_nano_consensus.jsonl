{"example": {"text": "[INCOMING_NURSE]: Good morning, Mr. Davies. I’m Jack, and I’ll be your nurse for today. We’ll just do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that’s okay.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Hi, Mr. Davies. This is Emma the nurse taking over for the day. Could you please confirm your full name?\n[PATIENT]: Michael Davies.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thank you. And your date of birth? [PATIENT]: First July 1985. [OUTGOING_NURSE]: And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart. So, Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases — who I think will be the consultant covering this week. Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He’s currently being barrier nursed in isolation. Full PPE is required before entering — though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case. He’s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight — not sure how many. Managed with oral rehydration and IV fluids. No vomiting that I’m aware of. Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn’t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling “a little off” earlier. Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I’m not completely sure if they’ve been through yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Davies, how are you feeling this morning? Any nausea or cramping?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but no pain. Just still needing the bathroom a lot.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay, thanks. He’s aware of the need to remain in isolation and has mostly been cooperative with infection control steps. No visitors allowed at this stage, though I think his partner’s been trying to contact the ward. Dr. Kumar should be reviewing later today — I’m not sure of the exact time yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. I’ll keep monitoring his fluids, stool frequency, and general symptoms, and check in again after the review. If there’s any issue with supplies or isolation process, I’ll raise it with infection control.\n[PATIENT]: No problem.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Mr. Davies. Please use your call bell if you need anything. I’ll be finishing up my shift shortly.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks, I’ll be back soon to recheck your obs and update your chart.\n", "gold_spans": [{"start": 601, "end": 656, "token_start": 144, "token_end": 153, "label": "SITUATION"}, {"start": 724, "end": 814, "token_start": 163, "token_end": 179, "label": "SITUATION"}, {"start": 822, "end": 862, "token_start": 181, "token_end": 188, "label": "SITUATION"}, {"start": 906, "end": 963, "token_start": 199, "token_end": 209, "label": "SITUATION"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1096, "token_start": 229, "token_end": 236, "label": "ASSESSMENT"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1721, "token_start": 356, "token_end": 371, "label": "ASSESSMENT"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 2000, "token_start": 421, "token_end": 427, "label": "RECOMMENDATION"}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2278, "token_start": 449, "token_end": 489, "label": "RECOMMENDATION"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2513, "token_start": 534, "token_end": 547, "label": "RECOMMENDATION"}]}, "prediction": {"pred_spans": [{"label": "SITUATION", "quote": "Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection."}, {"label": "SITUATION", "quote": "He’s currently being barrier nursed in isolation."}, {"label": "SITUATION", "quote": "Full PPE is required before entering — though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case."}, {"label": "SITUATION", "quote": "He’s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk."}, {"label": "BACKGROUND", "quote": "Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases — who I think will be the consultant covering this week."}, {"label": "BACKGROUND", "quote": "And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart."}, {"label": "BACKGROUND", "quote": "Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn’t back yet."}, {"label": "BACKGROUND", "quote": "Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I’m not completely sure if they’ve been through yet."}, {"label": "ASSESSMENT", "quote": "He’s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight — not sure how many."}, {"label": "ASSESSMENT", "quote": "No vomiting that I’m aware of."}, {"label": "ASSESSMENT", "quote": "He’s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning."}, {"label": "ASSESSMENT", "quote": "No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling “a little off” earlier."}, {"label": "ASSESSMENT", "quote": "A bit tired, but no pain.

Is that okay?\n[PATIENT]: Sure, that’s fine.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Priya. This is Alexander Marek in Room 4, under Dr Gaylor. Alex, can you confirm your full name and date of birth for us?\n[PATIENT]: Alexander Marek, 12-09-58.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. Any allergies to medications?\n[PATIENT]: None that I know of.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay. So, Alex is 66 years old, admitted with acute on chronic renal failure. He’s on home haemodialysis normally.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He has a history of end-stage renal failure, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression. He also has atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Okay.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: We need his warfarin level today to guide dosing. ED drew bloods but missed the warfarin/INR, so that still needs to be taken and then please get the doctors to review the result.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll take the INR straight after handover and flag it with the team.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: His potassium this morning is 6.2, so very high. The doctors are aware and we’re waiting on their treatment orders. I’ve printed the hyperkalaemia protocol and left it just outside the notes if you need it.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks, I see it there. I’ll follow up for orders.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s for renal ultrasound and biopsy to be arranged by the renal team.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He's for daily weight and he’s 82 kilograms today.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: His Lying and standing blood pressures are stable—no postural drop.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: AV fistula observations are good: there’s a bruit and thrill present.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Blood glucose levels QID; latest BGL is 5.6.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Perfect. Alex, do you usually dialyze Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings?\n[PATIENT]: Yes, M-W-F in the mornings. I had dialysis yesterday.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: I’ve called the dialysis unit to let them know he’s admitted and needs scheduling while he’s here.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, I’ll coordinate with them for the next session.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Otherwise he’s stable at the moment.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Alex, anything you want to add or anything you need right now?\n[PATIENT]: No, I’m okay, thank you.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll draw your INR now, and chase the team for the hyperkalaemia orders, \n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Sounds good.

A social worker referral has been made to explore home support and childcare options.\n[PHYSIOTHERAPIST]: Hi Jessica, I’m Priya from physio. I’ve reviewed your chart and will work with you post-op to help regain movement and strength in your arm. For now, just rest and keep the arm supported. After surgery, we’ll start gentle exercises and discuss strategies for managing daily tasks one-handed.\n[PATIENT]: Okay, I’m worried about how I’ll manage with the kids.\n[PHYSIOTHERAPIST]: That’s understandable. We’ll work closely with the social worker and nursing team to make sure you have the right support in place.\n[SOCIAL WORKER]: Hi Jessica, I’m Mark from social work. I understand you’re concerned about managing at home after surgery. Can you tell me a bit about your current support system?\n[PATIENT]: It’s just me and the kids. My mum lives interstate and I don’t have anyone nearby.\n[SOCIAL WORKER]: Thanks for sharing. I’ll look into short-term home care options and community support services. We can also explore childcare assistance while you recover. I’ll keep you updated and help with any paperwork.\n[NURSE AMY]: I’ll continue monitoring your pain and neurovascular status, and coordinate with the surgical team.
