He’s being started on warfarin for atrial fibrillation post-op, and I’m organising his discharge medications and follow-up.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. What’s the current plan?\n[PHARMACIST]: He’s had two doses of warfarin so far—5 mg on Day 1 and 3 mg yesterday. His INR this morning was 1.6, so still subtherapeutic. I’ve charted 3 mg again today, and we’ll need to arrange ongoing INR monitoring through his GP or local pathology service.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay. Has the GP been contacted?\n[PHARMACIST]: Not yet. I was going to ask if you’d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2–3 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I’ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork. Has he been counselled?\n[PHARMACIST]: Yes, I’ve spoken with him about, Dietary interactions (especially vitamin K), Bleeding risks, Signs to report (e.g. bruising, blood in urine/stool), Avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol, He’s aware and has agreed to follow up with his GP.\n[DOCTOR]: Great. Any other meds to note?\n[PHARMACIST]: He’s also on, Metoprolol 25 mg BD, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Paracetamol PRN, No known drug allergies.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect.

It’s running over 24 hours via central line, and we’re monitoring daily bloods—including U&Es, LFTs, glucose, and triglycerides. His fluid balance and weight should be tracked daily.\n[NURSE]: Any specific concerns?\n[DIETITIAN]: Yes, he’s at risk of refeeding syndrome, so we’ve started thiamine supplementation and are watching his phosphate and magnesium levels closely. So far, electrolytes are stable.\n[NURSE]: Is he tolerating the TPN well?\n[DIETITIAN]: Yes, no signs of intolerance. No nausea or vomiting. He’s alert and understands the plan. We’ve discussed the importance of not disconnecting the line and keeping the TPN pump running continuously.\n[NURSE]: (to patient) Hi Mr. King, I’ll be looking after you today. How are you feeling?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but okay. I’m just hoping I can eat again soon.\n[DIETITIAN]: We’re aiming to reassess gut function in the next 48 hours. Once bowel sounds return and surgical team clears it, we’ll start clear fluids, then build up gradually.\n[NURSE]: I’ll monitor his obs, fluid balance, and bloods.

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart. So, Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases — who I think will be the consultant covering this week. Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He’s currently being barrier nursed in isolation. Full PPE is required before entering — though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case. He’s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight — not sure how many. Managed with oral rehydration and IV fluids. No vomiting that I’m aware of. Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn’t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling “a little off” earlier. Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I’m not completely sure if they’ve been through yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Davies, how are you feeling this morning? Any nausea or cramping?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but no pain. Just still needing the bathroom a lot.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay, thanks. He’s aware of the need to remain in isolation and has mostly been cooperative with infection control steps. No visitors allowed at this stage, though I think his partner’s been trying to contact the ward. Dr. Kumar should be reviewing later today — I’m not sure of the exact time yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. I’ll keep monitoring his fluids, stool frequency, and general symptoms, and check in again after the review. If there’s any issue with supplies or isolation process, I’ll raise it with infection control.\n[PATIENT]: No problem.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Mr. Davies.

Evelyn, this is Nurse Tom, who’ll be looking after you until your transport arrives.\n[TRANSIT LOUNGE NURSE]: Hi Evelyn, lovely to meet you. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable while you wait.\n[WARD NURSE]: Evelyn was admitted five days ago with aspiration pneumonia. She’s responded well to IV antibiotics and supportive care. She’s now afebrile, respiratory rate is 18, SpO? 96% on room air, and she’s mobilising short distances with assistance.\n[TRANSIT LOUNGE NURSE]: Great. Any swallowing concerns?\n[WARD NURSE]: Yes, she has known dysphagia—thickened fluids and minced moist diet. She’s been reviewed by speech pathology and is safe to resume her usual nursing home diet plan. No signs of aspiration since admission.\n[TRANSIT LOUNGE NURSE]: Okay. Any medications due?\n[WARD NURSE]: No meds due during transit. She’s had her morning meds—oral antibiotics completed yesterday. No allergies. She has a 22G IV in the left hand, but it can be removed before discharge.\n[TRANSIT LOUNGE NURSE]: Any behavioural concerns?\n[WARD NURSE]: No. She’s pleasant, a bit confused at times but reorients easily. Nursing home staff are aware and familiar with her baseline.\n[TRANSIT LOUNGE NURSE]: Got it. Is transport booked?\n[WARD NURSE]: Yes, booked for 11:30 AM. All discharge paperwork is complete, including medication summary and nursing home handover form. Please let the team know if there’s any delay or change in her condition.", "gold_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 151, "token_start": 18, "token_end": 32, "label": "SITUATION"}, {"start": 358, "end":
