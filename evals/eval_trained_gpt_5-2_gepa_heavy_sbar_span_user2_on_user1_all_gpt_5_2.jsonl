{"example":{"text":"[DOCTOR]: Hi, I\u2019m handing over Mr. Amir Rahman, 63 years old, admitted yesterday with what looks like a large anterior MI \u2014 the ECG was fairly convincing. He\u2019s currently in ICU. They started an intra\u2011aortic balloon pump yesterday evening, mainly as a bridge to CABG, which is tentatively booked for two days from now, but that might shift depending on his stability.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Thanks. Can you give me a quick overview?\n[DOCTOR]: Sure. He\u2019s still a bit haemodynamically shaky post\u2011MI, with ongoing low cardiac output. The IABP went in this morning via the femoral artery \u2014 I believe the cardiology registrar did it. It\u2019s set to 1:1 augmentation. So far, he seems to be responding \u2014 BP\u2019s come up a bit, and lactates look like they\u2019re trending down, though the last result isn\u2019t in yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any other lines or support?\n[DOCTOR]: Right, he\u2019s got an arterial line in the right radial for continuous BP monitoring, a central line in the right internal jugular, and an IDC in situ. I think he\u2019s also still connected to telemetry, but I\u2019ll need to double\u2011check if that\u2019s linked to the central monitoring unit. He\u2019s on low\u2011dose noradrenaline, sitting around 2 micrograms a minute, but that\u2019s fluctuated a little. IV heparin is running for balloon pump patency \u2014 pharmacy flagged a possible review of APTT later today.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any communication needs?\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, he\u2019s from a non\u2011English speaking background \u2014 Arabic\u2019s his first language. He understands basic English, but it\u2019s hit\u2011and\u2011miss for more complex instructions. Somebody requested an interpreter for the family conference, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s been booked yet. His son\u2019s bilingual and has been helping, though he might not be around later tonight.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any pain or sedation?\n[DOCTOR]: He\u2019s alert and orientated. No sedation required at this stage. Pain\u2019s reasonably controlled with paracetamol and occasional oxycodone \u2014 he said it\u2019s \u201cokay,\u201d but sounded a bit unsure. He\u2019s anxious \u2014 understandably \u2014 so maybe consider whether some short\u2011acting anxiolytic\u2019s needed if he escalates later.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any allergies or medications?\n[DOCTOR]: No known drug allergies as far as documented. Meds include aspirin 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg nocte, the IV heparin infusion, noradrenaline, and the PRNs \u2014 paracetamol and oxycodone. I\u2019ll have to check if his beta blocker\u2019s been restarted post\u2011MI; cardiology had mentioned it but I didn\u2019t see an order yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Thanks.

{"example":{"text":"[INCOMING_NURSE]: Good morning, Mr. Davies. I\u2019m Jack, and I\u2019ll be your nurse for today. We\u2019ll just do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that\u2019s okay.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Hi, Mr. Davies. This is Emma the nurse taking over for the day. Could you please confirm your full name?\n[PATIENT]: Michael Davies.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thank you. And your date of birth? [PATIENT]: First July 1985. [OUTGOING_NURSE]: And your URN on the armband is 231879, which is what I have on the chart. So, Mr. Davies is under Dr. Kumar from Infectious Diseases \u2014 who I think will be the consultant covering this week. Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection. He\u2019s currently being barrier nursed in isolation. Full PPE is required before entering \u2014 though I think they were short on gowns earlier, so check the supply trolley just in case. He\u2019s on contact precautions, given the transmission risk.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s had several episodes of diarrhoea overnight \u2014 not sure how many. Managed with oral rehydration and IV fluids. No vomiting that I\u2019m aware of. Stool sample was sent and the initial report suggests rotavirus, but the full panel isn\u2019t back yet.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s tolerating small sips of water and bits of dry toast this morning. No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca little off\u201d earlier. Continence aids are in use, and environmental services were notified for enhanced cleaning last night, but I\u2019m not completely sure if they\u2019ve been through yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Davies, how are you feeling this morning? Any nausea or cramping?\n[PATIENT]: A bit tired, but no pain. Just still needing the bathroom a lot.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Okay, thanks. He\u2019s aware of the need to remain in isolation and has mostly been cooperative with infection control steps. No visitors allowed at this stage, though I think his partner\u2019s been trying to contact the ward. Dr. Kumar should be reviewing later today \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of the exact time yet.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great, thank you. I\u2019ll keep monitoring his fluids, stool frequency, and general symptoms, and check in again after the review. If there\u2019s any issue with supplies or isolation process, I\u2019ll raise it with infection control.\n[PATIENT]: No problem.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thanks, Mr. Davies. Please use your call bell if you need anything. I\u2019ll be finishing up my shift shortly.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks, I\u2019ll be back soon to recheck your obs and update your chart.\n","gold_spans":[{"start":599,"end":963,"token_start":143,"token_end":209,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":980,"end":1227,"token_start":214,"token_end":264,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1244,"end":1425,"token_start":269,"token_end":306,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1574,"end":1645,"token_start":335,"token_end":350,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1655,"end":1721,"token_start":355,"token_end":371,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":1752,"end":2038,"token_start":380,"token_end":438,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":2073,"end":2278,"token_start":448,"token_end":489,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":2451,"end":2513,"token_start":533,"token_end":547,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"}]},"prediction":{"pred_spans":[{"label":"SITUATION","quote":"Mr. Davies was admitted yesterday with what seems to be acute gastroenteritis, most likely secondary to rotavirus infection.

CT chest shows a 3.8 cm lesion with no definite mediastinal involvement, but margins are still being reviewed. The PET from last week shows localized uptake, though I think pathology hasn\u2019t correlated all the findings yet.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s currently haemodynamically stable.

IV fluids were stopped overnight; he\u2019s nil by mouth while waiting for the team to confirm theatre timing, which I think will depend on bed availability and the PFT results.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any relevant medical history?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes \u2014 hypertension controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, former smoker, about a 30\u2011pack\u2011year history, no diabetes that I know of, and no previous thoracic surgery. Oncology mentioned possible mild COPD features, but that hasn\u2019t been formally diagnosed.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: So, plan is MDT review today for potential lobectomy or segmentectomy, is that right?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes, that\u2019s the plan as far as I know.

How are you feeling?\n[PATIENT]: Still a bit breathless, but better than this morning.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Joan came in overnight with an acute exacerbation of COPD\u2014increased shortness of breath, wheeze, and productive cough. She\u2019s now on IV ceftriaxone and IV hydrocortisone, both charted for 3 days. She\u2019s also on salbutamol and ipratropium nebs Q4H.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Got it. What\u2019s her oxygen requirement?\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She\u2019s on 2 L via nasal prongs to keep sats between 88\u201392%\u2014that\u2019s her target range. She desats quickly if off oxygen. Her Q-ADDS score was 4 earlier due to increased RR and oxygen requirement, so she\u2019s on 2-hourly observations.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Any recent changes?\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She\u2019s improving slowly. RR is down to 22, sats 91% on 2 L, HR 96, BP 134/78, Temp 37.4. She\u2019s afebrile now. We\u2019ve started a fluid balance chart\u2014she\u2019s on IV fluids at 75 mL/hr due to poor oral intake. Strict input/output is being monitored.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Any comorbidities?\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Yes\u2014hypertension and osteoporosis. No known drug allergies. She\u2019s normally independent at home but has needed assistance with ADLs today due to fatigue.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Joan, are you managing okay with meals and drinks?\n[PATIENT]: Not really hungry, but I\u2019ve had some soup and water.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: That\u2019s okay\u2014we\u2019ll keep encouraging fluids and monitor your intake.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She\u2019s also on a respiratory chart\u2014we\u2019re tracking sputum colour, volume, and work of breathing. Physio has been to see her and will review again tomorrow.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks. Joan, I\u2019ll check your obs shortly and make sure your breathing stays comfortable. Let me know if you feel more breathless or unwell.\n[PATIENT]: Will do. Thank you both.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: All documentation is up to date\u2014Q-ADDS, fluid balance, and respiratory charting.

He\u2019s also refusing routine obs.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Any signs of delirium?\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Yes \u2014 4AT score is 6. He appears intermittently disoriented and his mental state is fluctuating. Doctors have requested delirium care strategies \u2014 regular reorientation, low-stimulus environment, clear explanations. Food and fluid charts commenced.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: What\u2019s his legal and social situation?\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s under guardianship through the Office of the Public Guardian. No local family or supports.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: And the current risk and plan?\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He\u2019s refusing oral meds, so the team is considering alternative routes if refusal persists. Needs close supervision for nutrition, hydration, and risk of further deterioration. Maintain reorientation and escalate if agitation or aggression increases.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks. I\u2019ll continue with the delirium care approach and monitor intake and risk.","gold_spans":[{"start":72,"end":194,"token_start":18,"token_end":35,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":212,"end":243,"token_start":41,"token_end":46,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":261,"end":453,"token_start":52,"token_end":88,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":471,"end":495,"token_start":94,"token_end":99,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":512,"end":609,"token_start":104,"token_end":121,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":609,"end":729,"token_start":122,"token_end":140,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":730,"end":761,"token_start":141,"token_end":145,"label":"ASSESSMENT"},{"start":781,"end":818,"token_start":152,"token_end":158,"label":"BACKGROUND"},{"start":836,"end":932,"token_start":164,"token_end":181,"label":"BACKGROUND"},{"start":1001,"end":1024,"token_start":200,"token_end":204,"label":"SITUATION"},{"start":1024,"end":1091,"token_start":205,"token_end":215,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":1091,"end":1250,"token_start":216,"token_end":239,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"},{"start":1278,"end":1351,"token_start":248,"token_end":260,"label":"RECOMMENDATION"}]},"prediction":{"pred_spans":[{"label":"SITUATION","quote":"Diagnosis is late-onset schizophrenia, admitted with persecutory delusions."},{"label":"ASSESSMENT","quote":"He remains suspicious and is refusing meals, stating that his food is poisoned.
