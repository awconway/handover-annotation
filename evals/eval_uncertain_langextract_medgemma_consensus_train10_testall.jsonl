{"example":{"text":"[NURSE]: Hi Dr. Patel, I need to escalate a concern about Mr. Thomas Nguyen, 74 years old, currently in bed 5 on the urology ward. He\u2019s been deteriorating clinically \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s triggering it, but I think he needs a medical review soon, possibly urgently.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, what\u2019s going on?\n[NURSE]: He was admitted yesterday with acute urinary retention and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A catheter was inserted last night, but over the last few hours he seems to have become more lethargic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. His urine output\u2019s dropped quite a bit \u2014 not sure if the catheter\u2019s blocked or if he\u2019s just shutting down.\n[DOCTOR]: What are his current vitals?\n[NURSE]: BP\u2019s sitting around 88/54, HR about 112, RR 22, SpO\u2082 96% on room air, temp 37.9\u00b0C. He\u2019s only passed about 40 mL in the last three hours, give or take. His Q\u2011ADDS is around 7, though I\u2019ll double\u2011check \u2014 it might be 8 depending on the scoring for output.\n[DOCTOR]: Any pain or other symptoms?\n[NURSE]: He\u2019s got some lower abdominal discomfort \u2014 says it\u2019s \u201ctight\u201d more than painful \u2014 and a low\u2011grade fever. He\u2019s a bit confused, which the team on shift earlier didn\u2019t mention, so that\u2019s new. No vomiting that I\u2019ve seen, but he\u2019s refusing fluids and looks a little clammy.\n[DOCTOR]: Any recent bloods?\n[NURSE]: Yes, this morning\u2019s labs: white cell 14.6, CRP 98, creatinine 168 from 102 yesterday, eGFR down to 44 \u2014 sorry, I think it\u2019s 44, not 4, but I can confirm. Looks like he might be heading into an acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to infection, obstruction, or both. Micro hasn\u2019t come back yet, but urine looked cloudy.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll come and review him now \u2014 give me about ten minutes. We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction\u2019s worsening. I\u2019ll decide once I\u2019ve seen him.\n[NURSE]: Alright, I\u2019ll keep an eye on him for now and prepare in case you want to transfer or escalate further.","gold_spans":[{"start":168,"end":209,"label":"Unknown fact"},{"start":858,"end":880,"label":"Hedging"},{"start":907,"end":958,"label":"Hedging"}]},"prediction":{"pred_spans":[{"label":"Vagueness","quote":"I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s triggering it"},{"label":"Vagueness","quote":"give or take"},{"label":"Vagueness","quote":"might be 8 depending on the scoring for output"},{"label":"Vagueness","quote":"give me about ten minutes"}],"span_metrics":{"precision":0.0,"recall":0.0,"f1":0.0,"tp":0.0,"pred_count":4,"gold_count":3,"detailed":{"preds":[{"idx":0,"label":"Vagueness","quote":"I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s triggering it","span":[168,209]},{"idx":1,"label":"Vagueness","quote":"give or take","span":[844,856]},{"idx":2,"label":"Vagueness","quote":"might be 8 depending on the scoring for output","span":[912,958]},{"idx":3,"label":"Vagueness","quote":"give me about ten minutes","span":[1690,1715]}],"golds":[{"idx":0,"label":"Unknown fact","span":[168,209]},{"idx":1,"label":"Hedging","span":[858,880]},{"idx":2,"label":"Hedging","span":[907,958]}],"matches":[]},"true_positives":0.0}},"score":0.0}
{"example":{"text":"[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Good morning, Mr. Carter. I\u2019m Dr. Chen from City Thoracic Unit. I\u2019ll just get the handover from my colleague now, if that\u2019s alright.\n[PATIENT]: Yes, that\u2019s fine.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: This should be Bed 5, James Carter, 62 years old, under Dr. Singh \u2014 I believe he\u2019s the thoracic surgeon on today\u2019s roster. Mr. Carter was admitted yesterday after referral from oncology for surgical review of what appears to be a left upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma. He\u2019s had increasing shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month \u2014 he\u2019s not sure exactly when it started worsening. CT chest shows a 3.8 cm lesion with no definite mediastinal involvement, but margins are still being reviewed. The PET from last week shows localized uptake, though I think pathology hasn\u2019t correlated all the findings yet.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s currently haemodynamically stable. No haemoptysis or chest pain reported overnight. Oxygen sats are sitting around 96% on room air. Pain\u2019s been manageable with regular paracetamol. No major changes overnight, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca bit tighter\u201d this morning.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Hi Mr. Carter, can I just confirm your full name for me?\n[PATIENT]: James Carter.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, and I\u2019ll check your wristband\u2026 that matches. Are you having any pain or discomfort at the moment?\n[PATIENT]: Just some chest tightness, not bad though.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Vitals this morning roughly BP 132/78, HR 76, RR 18, Temp 36.9, SpO\u2082 96%. I\u2019ll double\u2011check the printed obs to be sure.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any allergies?\n[PATIENT]: No known allergies.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Okay, I\u2019ll confirm that in the chart. What about current medications?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s on regular paracetamol one gram QID, salbutamol inhaler as needed, pantoprazole 40 daily. No antibiotics at present \u2014 there was some discussion yesterday about prophylaxis, but decision pending surgical review. IV fluids were stopped overnight; he\u2019s nil by mouth while waiting for the team to confirm theatre timing, which I think will depend on bed availability and the PFT results.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any relevant medical history?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes \u2014 hypertension controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, former smoker, about a 30\u2011pack\u2011year history, no diabetes that I know of, and no previous thoracic surgery. Oncology mentioned possible mild COPD features, but that hasn\u2019t been formally diagnosed.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: So, plan is MDT review today for potential lobectomy or segmentectomy, is that right?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes, that\u2019s the plan as far as I know. Pulmonary function tests are pending \u2014 I think they were booked for this morning, but not entirely sure if they\u2019ve been collected yet. Bloods from yesterday were within normal limits \u2014 WCC 7.8, CRP 12, renal and liver fine, ECG normal sinus rhythm. No other outstanding investigations I\u2019m aware of.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, thanks. Mr. Carter, anything you need before we wrap up?\n[PATIENT]: No, I\u2019m okay. Just waiting to find out what\u2019s happening with surgery.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Perfect. We\u2019ll review your results and let you know once the MDT discussion\u2019s finished \u2014 should be sometime later today, depending on when the list starts.","gold_spans":[{"start":268,"end":322,"label":"Hedging"},{"start":2616,"end":2710,"label":"Hedging"}]},"prediction":{"pred_spans":[{"label":"Vagueness","quote":"he\u2019s not sure exactly when it started worsening"},{"label":"Hedging","quote":"there was some discussion yesterday about prophylaxis, but decision pending surgical review"}],"span_metrics":{"precision":0.0,"recall":0.0,"f1":0.0,"tp":0.0,"pred_count":2,"gold_count":2,"detailed":{"preds":[{"idx":0,"label":"Vagueness","quote":"he\u2019s not sure exactly when it started worsening","span":[551,598]},{"idx":1,"label":"Hedging","quote":"there was some discussion yesterday about prophylaxis, but decision pending surgical review","span":[1828,1919]}],"golds":[{"idx":0,"label":"Hedging","span":[268,322]},{"idx":1,"label":"Hedging","span":[2616,2710]}],"matches":[]},"true_positives":0.0}},"score":0.0}
{"example":{"text":"[DOCTOR]: Hi, I\u2019m handing over Mr. Amir Rahman, 63 years old, admitted yesterday with what looks like a large anterior MI \u2014 the ECG was fairly convincing. He\u2019s currently in ICU. They started an intra\u2011aortic balloon pump yesterday evening, mainly as a bridge to CABG, which is tentatively booked for two days from now, but that might shift depending on his stability.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Thanks. Can you give me a quick overview?\n[DOCTOR]: Sure. He\u2019s still a bit haemodynamically shaky post\u2011MI, with ongoing low cardiac output. The IABP went in this morning via the femoral artery \u2014 I believe the cardiology registrar did it. It\u2019s set to 1:1 augmentation. So far, he seems to be responding \u2014 BP\u2019s come up a bit, and lactates look like they\u2019re trending down, though the last result isn\u2019t in yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any other lines or support?\n[DOCTOR]: Right, he\u2019s got an arterial line in the right radial for continuous BP monitoring, a central line in the right internal jugular, and an IDC in situ. I think he\u2019s also still connected to telemetry, but I\u2019ll need to double\u2011check if that\u2019s linked to the central monitoring unit. He\u2019s on low\u2011dose noradrenaline, sitting around 2 micrograms a minute, but that\u2019s fluctuated a little. IV heparin is running for balloon pump patency \u2014 pharmacy flagged a possible review of APTT later today.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any communication needs?\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, he\u2019s from a non\u2011English speaking background \u2014 Arabic\u2019s his first language. He understands basic English, but it\u2019s hit\u2011and\u2011miss for more complex instructions. Somebody requested an interpreter for the family conference, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s been booked yet. His son\u2019s bilingual and has been helping, though he might not be around later tonight.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any pain or sedation?\n[DOCTOR]: He\u2019s alert and orientated. No sedation required at this stage. Pain\u2019s reasonably controlled with paracetamol and occasional oxycodone \u2014 he said it\u2019s \u201cokay,\u201d but sounded a bit unsure. He\u2019s anxious \u2014 understandably \u2014 so maybe consider whether some short\u2011acting anxiolytic\u2019s needed if he escalates later.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any allergies or medications?\n[DOCTOR]: No known drug allergies as far as documented. Meds include aspirin 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg nocte, the IV heparin infusion, noradrenaline, and the PRNs \u2014 paracetamol and oxycodone. I\u2019ll have to check if his beta blocker\u2019s been restarted post\u2011MI; cardiology had mentioned it but I didn\u2019t see an order yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Thanks. I\u2019ll keep monitoring IABP function and haemodynamics closely.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect. Let me know if there\u2019s any change in rhythm, perfusion, or balloon timing.
