I\u2019ve charted 3 mg again today, and we\u2019ll need to arrange ongoing INR monitoring through his GP or local pathology service.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay. Has the GP been contacted?\n[PHARMACIST]: Not yet. I was going to ask if you\u2019d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2\u20133 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I\u2019ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork.
