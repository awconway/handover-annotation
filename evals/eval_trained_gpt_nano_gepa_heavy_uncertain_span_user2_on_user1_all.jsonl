{"example":{"text":"[DOCTOR]: Hi, I\u2019m handing over Mr. Amir Rahman, 63 years old, admitted yesterday with what looks like a large anterior MI \u2014 the ECG was fairly convincing.

Can you give me a quick overview?\n[DOCTOR]: Sure. He\u2019s still a bit haemodynamically shaky post\u2011MI, with ongoing low cardiac output. The IABP went in this morning via the femoral artery \u2014 I believe the cardiology registrar did it. It\u2019s set to 1:1 augmentation. So far, he seems to be responding \u2014 BP\u2019s come up a bit, and lactates look like they\u2019re trending down, though the last result isn\u2019t in yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any other lines or support?\n[DOCTOR]: Right, he\u2019s got an arterial line in the right radial for continuous BP monitoring, a central line in the right internal jugular, and an IDC in situ. I think he\u2019s also still connected to telemetry, but I\u2019ll need to double\u2011check if that\u2019s linked to the central monitoring unit. He\u2019s on low\u2011dose noradrenaline, sitting around 2 micrograms a minute, but that\u2019s fluctuated a little. IV heparin is running for balloon pump patency \u2014 pharmacy flagged a possible review of APTT later today.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any communication needs?\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, he\u2019s from a non\u2011English speaking background \u2014 Arabic\u2019s his first language. He understands basic English, but it\u2019s hit\u2011and\u2011miss for more complex instructions. Somebody requested an interpreter for the family conference, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s been booked yet. His son\u2019s bilingual and has been helping, though he might not be around later tonight.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any pain or sedation?\n[DOCTOR]: He\u2019s alert and orientated. No sedation required at this stage. Pain\u2019s reasonably controlled with paracetamol and occasional oxycodone \u2014 he said it\u2019s \u201cokay,\u201d but sounded a bit unsure. He\u2019s anxious \u2014 understandably \u2014 so maybe consider whether some short\u2011acting anxiolytic\u2019s needed if he escalates later.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any allergies or medications?\n[DOCTOR]: No known drug allergies as far as documented. Meds include aspirin 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg nocte, the IV heparin infusion, noradrenaline, and the PRNs \u2014 paracetamol and oxycodone.

No abdominal pain reported, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca little off\u201d earlier.

I\u2019ll just get the handover from my colleague now, if that\u2019s alright.\n[PATIENT]: Yes, that\u2019s fine.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: This should be Bed 5, James Carter, 62 years old, under Dr. Singh \u2014 I believe he\u2019s the thoracic surgeon on today\u2019s roster. Mr. Carter was admitted yesterday after referral from oncology for surgical review of what appears to be a left upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma. He\u2019s had increasing shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month \u2014 he\u2019s not sure exactly when it started worsening. CT chest shows a 3.8 cm lesion with no definite mediastinal involvement, but margins are still being reviewed. The PET from last week shows localized uptake, though I think pathology hasn\u2019t correlated all the findings yet.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s currently haemodynamically stable. No haemoptysis or chest pain reported overnight. Oxygen sats are sitting around 96% on room air. Pain\u2019s been manageable with regular paracetamol. No major changes overnight, though he mentioned feeling \u201ca bit tighter\u201d this morning.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Hi Mr. Carter, can I just confirm your full name for me?\n[PATIENT]: James Carter.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, and I\u2019ll check your wristband\u2026 that matches. Are you having any pain or discomfort at the moment?\n[PATIENT]: Just some chest tightness, not bad though.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Vitals this morning roughly BP 132/78, HR 76, RR 18, Temp 36.9, SpO\u2082 96%. I\u2019ll double\u2011check the printed obs to be sure.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any allergies?\n[PATIENT]: No known allergies.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Okay, I\u2019ll confirm that in the chart. What about current medications?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He\u2019s on regular paracetamol one gram QID, salbutamol inhaler as needed, pantoprazole 40 daily. No antibiotics at present \u2014 there was some discussion yesterday about prophylaxis, but decision pending surgical review. IV fluids were stopped overnight; he\u2019s nil by mouth while waiting for the team to confirm theatre timing, which I think will depend on bed availability and the PFT results.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any relevant medical history?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes \u2014 hypertension controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, former smoker, about a 30\u2011pack\u2011year history, no diabetes that I know of, and no previous thoracic surgery. Oncology mentioned possible mild COPD features, but that hasn\u2019t been formally diagnosed.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: So, plan is MDT review today for potential lobectomy or segmentectomy, is that right?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes, that\u2019s the plan as far as I know. Pulmonary function tests are pending \u2014 I think they were booked for this morning, but not entirely sure if they\u2019ve been collected yet. Bloods from yesterday were within normal limits \u2014 WCC 7.8, CRP 12, renal and liver fine, ECG normal sinus rhythm. No other outstanding investigations I\u2019m aware of.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, thanks. Mr. Carter, anything you need before we wrap up?\n[PATIENT]: No, I\u2019m okay.
