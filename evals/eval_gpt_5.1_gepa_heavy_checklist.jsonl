A catheter was inserted last night, but over the last few hours he seems to have become more lethargic, tachycardic, and hypotensive.

I\u2019ll come and review him now \u2014 give me about ten minutes. We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction\u2019s worsening.
