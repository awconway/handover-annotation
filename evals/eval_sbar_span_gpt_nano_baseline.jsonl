{"example":{"text":"[NURSE]: Hi Dr. Patel, I need to escalate a concern about Mr. Thomas Nguyen, 74 years old, currently in bed 5 on the urology ward. He\u2019s been deteriorating clinically \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s triggering it, but I think he needs a medical review soon, possibly urgently.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, what\u2019s going on?\n[NURSE]: He was admitted yesterday with acute urinary retention and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A catheter was inserted last night, but over the last few hours he seems to have become more lethargic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. His urine output\u2019s dropped quite a bit \u2014 not sure if the catheter\u2019s blocked or if he\u2019s just shutting down.\n[DOCTOR]: What are his current vitals?\n[NURSE]: BP\u2019s sitting around 88/54, HR about 112, RR 22, SpO\u2082 96% on room air, temp 37.9\u00b0C. He\u2019s only passed about 40 mL in the last three hours, give or take. His Q\u2011ADDS is around 7, though I\u2019ll double\u2011check \u2014 it might be 8 depending on the scoring for output.\n[DOCTOR]: Any pain or other symptoms?\n[NURSE]: He\u2019s got some lower abdominal discomfort \u2014 says it\u2019s \u201ctight\u201d more than painful \u2014 and a low\u2011grade fever. He\u2019s a bit confused, which the team on shift earlier didn\u2019t mention, so that\u2019s new. No vomiting that I\u2019ve seen, but he\u2019s refusing fluids and looks a little clammy.\n[DOCTOR]: Any recent bloods?\n[NURSE]: Yes, this morning\u2019s labs: white cell 14.6, CRP 98, creatinine 168 from 102 yesterday, eGFR down to 44 \u2014 sorry, I think it\u2019s 44, not 4, but I can confirm. Looks like he might be heading into an acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to infection, obstruction, or both. Micro hasn\u2019t come back yet, but urine looked cloudy.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll come and review him now \u2014 give me about ten minutes. We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction\u2019s worsening.
