{"example":{"text":"[PHARMACIST]: Hi Dr. Lee, I wanted to speak with you about Mr. James Carter, who\u2019s being discharged today. He\u2019s being started on warfarin for atrial fibrillation post-op, and I\u2019m organising his discharge medications and follow-up.\n[DOCTOR]: Thanks. What\u2019s the current plan?\n[PHARMACIST]: He\u2019s had two doses of warfarin so far\u20145 mg on Day 1 and 3 mg yesterday. His INR this morning was 1.6, so still subtherapeutic. I\u2019ve charted 3 mg again today, and we\u2019ll need to arrange ongoing INR monitoring through his GP or local pathology service.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay. Has the GP been contacted?\n[PHARMACIST]: Not yet. I was going to ask if you\u2019d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2\u20133 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I\u2019ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork. Has he been counselled?\n[PHARMACIST]: Yes, I\u2019ve spoken with him about, Dietary interactions (especially vitamin K), Bleeding risks, Signs to report (e.g. bruising, blood in urine/stool), Avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol, He\u2019s aware and has agreed to follow up with his GP.\n[DOCTOR]: Great. Any other meds to note?\n[PHARMACIST]: He\u2019s also on, Metoprolol 25 mg BD, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Paracetamol PRN, No known drug allergies.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect. I\u2019ll finalise the discharge summary and include the INR plan. Thanks for organising everything.\n[PHARMACIST]: No problem.

{"example":{"text":"[NURSE]: Hi Dr. Patel, I need to escalate a concern about Mr. Thomas Nguyen, 74 years old, currently in bed 5 on the urology ward. He\u2019s been deteriorating clinically \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s triggering it, but I think he needs a medical review soon, possibly urgently.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, what\u2019s going on?\n[NURSE]: He was admitted yesterday with acute urinary retention and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A catheter was inserted last night, but over the last few hours he seems to have become more lethargic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. His urine output\u2019s dropped quite a bit \u2014 not sure if the catheter\u2019s blocked or if he\u2019s just shutting down.\n[DOCTOR]: What are his current vitals?\n[NURSE]: BP\u2019s sitting around 88/54, HR about 112, RR 22, SpO\u2082 96% on room air, temp 37.9\u00b0C. He\u2019s only passed about 40 mL in the last three hours, give or take. His Q\u2011ADDS is around 7, though I\u2019ll double\u2011check \u2014 it might be 8 depending on the scoring for output.\n[DOCTOR]: Any pain or other symptoms?\n[NURSE]: He\u2019s got some lower abdominal discomfort \u2014 says it\u2019s \u201ctight\u201d more than painful \u2014 and a low\u2011grade fever. He\u2019s a bit confused, which the team on shift earlier didn\u2019t mention, so that\u2019s new. No vomiting that I\u2019ve seen, but he\u2019s refusing fluids and looks a little clammy.\n[DOCTOR]: Any recent bloods?\n[NURSE]: Yes, this morning\u2019s labs: white cell 14.6, CRP 98, creatinine 168 from 102 yesterday, eGFR down to 44 \u2014 sorry, I think it\u2019s 44, not 4, but I can confirm. Looks like he might be heading into an acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to infection, obstruction, or both. Micro hasn\u2019t come back yet, but urine looked cloudy.\n[DOCTOR]: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll come and review him now \u2014 give me about ten minutes. We may need imaging and probably to escalate to the surgical team if obstruction\u2019s worsening. I\u2019ll decide once I\u2019ve seen him.\n[NURSE]: Alright, I\u2019ll keep an eye on him for now and prepare in case you want to transfer or escalate
