    "instructions": "You are given a transcript of a clinical handover (nurse-to-nurse, nurse-to-doctor, etc.) that may also include dialogue with the patient and/or carer.\n\nYour task:\nReturn a list (array) of the category keys that are addressed in the transcript. Include a category if and only if it is explicitly or clearly implied by the text. Do not include categories based on speculation or assumption.\n\nOutput format:\n- A JSON-like list of strings (category keys), e.g.:\n  [\"introduction_patients\", \"sit_diagnosis\", \"assess_obs\"]\n\nDo not output any explanation, prose, or additional text—only the list.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nCATEGORIES AND DECISION RULES (CLINICAL HANDOVER)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUse the following table of categories. Be precise and conservative: the presence of a single, clearly relevant statement is enough to tag a category, but do not infer categories that are not clearly supported by the text.\n\n| Key                     | Description                                                         |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| introduction_clinicians | Introduction of **all** clinicians involved in handover            |\n| introduction_patients   | Introduction of clinicians involved in handover **to the patient/carer** |\n| invitation              | Invitation for patient/carer to participate in handover or ongoing care |\n| id_check                | ID check of 3 patient identifiers (name, date of birth, and ID number) |\n| sit_diagnosis           | Primary diagnosis; reason for admission                            |\n| sit_events              | Significant events or complications                                |\n| sit_status              | Current status (awaiting tests/procedures, on interim orders/plan) |\n| bg_history              | Relevant clinical and social history; comorbidities                |\n| bg_fall_risk            | Alerts - falls risk                                                |\n| bg_pi_risk              | Alerts - pressure injury risk                                      |\n| bg_allergies            | Alerts - allergies                                                 |\n| bg_acp                  | Advanced care planning                                             |\n| assess_obs              | Observations; Q-ADDS; recent escalations                           |\n| assess_pain             | Pain management                                                    |\n| assess_devices          | Devices; lines; vascular access                                    |\n| assess_monitoring       | Critical monitoring; alarms                                        |\n| assess_nutrition        | Nutrition; restrictions                                            |\n| assess_fluid_balance    | Fluid balance; restrictions                                        |\n| assess_infusions        | Infusions                                                          |\n| assess_medications      | Medication chart; flag high risk meds                              |\n| assess_pathology        | Pathology                                                          |\n| assess_mobility         | Mobility; aids                                                     |\n| assess_skin_integrity   | Skin integrity; interventions                                      |\n| rec_discharge_plan      | Discharge plan                                                     |\n| rec_actions             | Critical actions required (escalation/safety)                      |\n| rec_plan                | Care plan/pathway actions to follow up                             |\n| rec_patient_goals       | Asked patient/carer about goals and preferences                    |\n\nBelow are detailed clarifications and decision rules, including lessons from previous examples.\n\n--------------------------------\nINTRODUCTIONS AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT\n--------------------------------\n\n1. introduction_clinicians\n   - Tag only if the transcript explicitly shows **all** clinicians present in the handover being introduced to each other.\n   - There must be explicit introduction language, e.g.:\n     - “Hi, I’m Nurse Tessa and this is Dr. Lee.”\n   - It is not enough that two clinicians are talking; an explicit introduction is required.\n   - If it is unclear whether all clinicians present were introduced, do NOT tag this.\n\n2. introduction_patients\n   - Tag when clinicians introduce themselves or other clinicians **to the patient or carer**.\n   - Examples that qualify:\n     - “Peter, this is Nurse Jess from the coronary care unit, and Dr. Patel, who’s overseeing your care.”\n     - “Hi Mindy. I’m Sam, I’ll be looking after you today.”\n     - “Good Morning, Agatha. I’m Priya, I’ll be looking after you today.”\n   - You do NOT need every clinician to be introduced—any such introduction to the patient/carer is enough.\n\n3. invitation\n   - Tag when the patient/carer is explicitly invited to:\n     - Participate in the handover,\n     - Consent to the handover,\n     - Engage in their care by asking questions, expressing concerns, or alerting staff.\n   - Typical phrases that qualify:\n     - “Is that okay?” after saying “I’m just getting handover from X” at the bedside.\n     - “Is it okay if we do handover at the bedside?”\n     - “Do you mind if we talk about your care here?”\n     - “Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.”\n     - “Let us know what’s most comfortable.”\n     - “Press/buzz if you need us,” “Let the team know if it changes,” “If you need any help … just buzz us.”\n   - These count even if they refer to ongoing care rather than the handover moment itself; any explicit encouragement to speak up or seek help counts as invitation.\n\n4. rec_patient_goals\n   - Tag when the clinician **asks** the patient/carer what they want, need, or prefer regarding care, or checks whether they need anything now.\n   - Example triggers:\n     - “Mindy, please buzz if the chest pain worsens or you feel more short of breath.” → invitation, not rec_patient_goals by itself.\n     - “Anything else you need before I go, Mindy?”\n     - “Agatha, is there anything you need before we go?”\n     - “What’s most comfortable for you?” or “Let us know what’s most comfortable” (this also reflects preferences).\n   - It does not need to use the word “goals.” Any clear attempt to elicit current needs/preferences counts.\n\n5. id_check\n   - Tag only if **three** identifiers are clearly used: name, date of birth, and ID number (or equivalent such as medical record number).\n   - Examples:\n     - “Can you confirm your full name, date of birth, and hospital number?”\n   - If the transcript only includes:\n     - Name alone, or\n     - Name + age, or\n     - Name + date of birth (without ID number),\n     then do NOT tag id_check.\n   - In Example 3, only name and DOB are confirmed; this is **not** enough for id_check.\n\n--------------------------------\nSITUATION: DIAGNOSIS, EVENTS, STATUS\n--------------------------------\n\n6. sit_diagnosis\n   - Tag when the primary diagnosis or reason for admission is mentioned.\n   - Examples:\n     - “He’s being transferred to CCU with acute decompensated heart failure.”\n     - “She’s come in with an acute kidney injury for investigation.”\n     - “Mindy has recurrent lung cancer with chest pain and a cough.”\n   - It can be a brief phrase as long as it clearly states why the patient is in hospital or under current care.\n\n7. sit_events\n   - Tag for **significant events or complications** that occurred during the admission or recent care, distinct from the baseline diagnosis.\n   - Examples:\n     - “She had an episode of bradycardia overnight with HR dropping to 38.”\n     - “Fall overnight,” “post-op bleed requiring transfusion,” “cardiac arrest,” etc.\n   - Also include when there is a clear **change/deterioration** described as an event, e.g.:\n     - “Mindy’s been uncomfortable lying down.” (This is an evolving symptom/problem and was expected to be tagged as sit_events in Example 2.)\n   - Do NOT tag sit_events for routine, stable descriptions of condition (e.g., “still dyspnoeic at rest” as ongoing status) unless framed as a distinct new event or complication.\n\n8. sit_status\n   - Tag when the transcript describes **current overall status or phase of care**, especially:\n     - Awaiting tests/procedures/consults, or\n     - On specific interim orders/plans, or\n     - Clearly framed “for further monitoring” or similar.\n   - Examples that qualify (from feedback):\n     - Example 1: Patient is being transferred to CCU and “now in CCU for cardiac monitoring,” plus ongoing treatment orders → sit_status appropriate.\n     - Example 2: “She’s for further monitoring today.” → sit_status.\n     - General: “Awaiting CT scan,” “Psych team has been consulted and will review again tomorrow,” “On interim plan while awaiting echo.”\n   - Do NOT tag sit_status just because there are vital signs or general descriptive statements of condition without an explicit “awaiting”/phase/monitoring status.\n\n--------------------------------\nBACKGROUND: HISTORY, RISKS, ALLERGIES, ACP\n--------------------------------\n\n9. bg_history\n   - Tag for relevant past medical or social history/comorbidities.\n   - Examples:\n     - “History of ischaemic cardiomyopathy, EF 25%, and CKD stage 3.”\n     - “She had lung cancer five years ago.”\n     - “She was also a heavy smoker for about 10 years.”\n     - “As a kidney patient she’s on the usual daily bloods…” (underlying chronic condition implied).\n   - The admission diagnosis may also reflect background if pre-existing (e.g., eating disorder), but sit_diagnosis must be tagged separately.\n\n10. bg_fall_risk\n   - Tag when falls risk (as a specific alert) is mentioned or charted.\n   - Examples:\n     - “Falls Risk Chart – high risk due to confusion and mobility issues.”\n   - Do **not** infer this just because the patient is elderly, confused, or unsteady, unless falls risk is explicitly mentioned.\n\n11. bg_pi_risk\n   - Tag when **pressure injury risk** is discussed.\n   - Examples:\n     - “She’s at risk of pressure areas; on a pressure-relieving mattress and turned 2-hourly.”\n   - Look for explicit mention of pressure areas, mattresses, repositioning for pressure prevention, or labels like “PI risk.”\n\n12. bg_allergies\n   - Tag when allergies or no allergies are explicitly discussed.\n   - Examples:\n     - “No known allergies.”\n     - “Any allergies we should know about?” / “No, none that I know of.”\n   - Negative statements (no allergies) still qualify for this category.\n\n13. bg_acp\n   - Tag for **advanced care planning**:\n     - Code status (e.g., “NFR,” “Not for resuscitation”),\n     - Advance care directives or goals-of-care documents,\n     - Explicit EOL/advance care planning discussions.\n   - Example: “He’s for full resus,” “She has an advance care plan on file.”\n\n--------------------------------\nASSESSMENT: CURRENT CLINICAL STATE AND CARE\n--------------------------------\n\n14. assess_obs\n   - Tag when vital signs, observation scores, or observation frequency are mentioned.\n   - Includes:\n     - HR, BP, RR, Temp, SpO2, etc.\n     - Q-ADDS (or similar)—score values and/or frequency of obs.\n     - Statements like “All observations were stable,” “QADDS equals zero.”\n     - “He’s on hourly observations.”\n   - Examples (that should be tagged):\n     - “Q-ADDS score is 6—due to increased RR (28), borderline BP (98/60), and oxygen requirement.”\n     - “Her observations were stable for my whole shift so QADDS equals zero.”\n   - Do NOT tag assess_obs if none of the above (numbers, stability statements, obs scores, or frequency) are present. For example, Example 3 had no actual obs or obs frequency mentioned in the transcript; it should **not** be tagged as assess_obs.\n\n15. assess_pain\n   - Tag when pain or its management is discussed.\n   - Examples:\n     - “Any chest pain right now?”\n     - “I can get you some pain relief.”\n     - “He’s been complaining of wound pain.”\n   - Statements from patient (e.g., “It’s worse when I lie back”) related to pain also qualify when part of the handover.\n\n16. assess_devices\n   - Tag for devices, lines, vascular access, catheters, drains, or explicit statements about their presence/absence.\n   - Examples:\n     - “IV access?” / “Two good IVs—18G in the right AC and 20G in the left forearm.”\n     - “Any meds or infusions I need to be aware of?” (still devices/infusions related; in Example 2 this was expected to trigger assess_devices).\n     - “No additional lines or drains.”\n   - Mentioning oxygen via nasal prongs also implies a device, but is usually more relevant to obs; however, if lines/access are discussed, tag assess_devices.\n\n17. assess_monitoring\n   - Tag **only** for critical/continuous monitoring and alarms beyond routine obs.\n   - Examples that qualify:\n     - “He’s being transferred to CCU with acute decompensated heart failure” and “That’s why we’re moving you to CCU—to monitor you more closely.” (Example 1: assess_monitoring should be tagged.)\n     - “She’s in CCU for cardiac monitoring,” “On continuous telemetry with alarms set for HR < X.”\n   - Routine “Q-ADDS equals zero” or “for further monitoring today” is **not** automatically assess_monitoring unless clearly describing continuous or high-level monitored setting.\n   - Do NOT tag assess_monitoring for:\n     - Simple vital signs,\n     - Q-ADDS scores alone,\n     - “Routine monitoring” without explicit continuous/critical monitoring context.\n\n18. assess_nutrition\n   - Tag for nutrition, diet, feeding, or dietary restrictions.\n   - Examples:\n     - “On a diabetic diet.”\n     - “Strict food chart with dietitian input.”\n     - “NPO from midnight.”\n   - A “food and fluid chart” alone only implies nutrition if food intake/dietary limitations are emphasized; however, be conservative and ensure the focus is at least partly on diet, not only fluids.\n\n19. assess_fluid_balance\n   - Tag for **explicit fluid balance assessment**:\n     - Intake/output amounts,\n     - Presence of a fluid balance chart with volumes or fluid status,\n     - Fluid restrictions,\n     - Descriptions of being fluid positive/negative, or strict measurement of intake and output.\n   - Examples:\n     - “He’s on a strict fluid balance chart—he’s positive 1.2 L over the last 24 hours.”\n     - “We’ll be measuring everything you drink and all urine output—strict fluid chart.”\n     - “Continue strict fluid balance; daily weights.”\n   - Feedback clarification:\n     - In Example 1, “strict fluid balance chart—he’s positive 1.2 L” → correct to tag assess_fluid_balance.\n     - In Example 3, “strict fluid chart” and “continue strict fluid balance” → assess_fluid_balance should be tagged.\n     - However, do **not** tag assess_fluid_balance solely based on “food and fluid chart” without any mention of volumes, fluid status, or restriction; previous feedback states that was over-inclusive.\n\n20. assess_infusions\n   - Tag for **ongoing or continuous infusions** that require monitoring:\n     - IV fluids running at a rate,\n     - Continuous medication infusions (e.g., GTN infusion, insulin infusion, heparin infusion).\n   - Examples:\n     - “GTN infusion was commenced this morning for ongoing hypertension and chest tightness” and “GTN is running via pump on the right side.” (In Example 1, this justified assess_infusions.)\n   - Distinguish from single-dose IV meds:\n     - Single-dose IV antibiotics given once daily are usually classified under assess_medications (not assess_infusions) unless described explicitly as an infusion that is running and requires monitoring.\n   - Follow this stricter rule for future classification:\n     - Only tag assess_infusions when there is clear indication of a running drip/continuous infusion to be monitored.\n\n21. assess_medications\n   - Tag whenever the medication chart or any medications (oral, IV, PRN, regular) are discussed.\n   - Examples:\n     - “He’s been started on IV frusemide 40 mg BD, and a GTN infusion was commenced this morning.”\n     - “He’s on carvedilol, spironolactone, and atorvastatin.”\n     - “Any meds or infusions I need to be aware of?” / “No nothing at the moment.” (Still discussion of meds.)\n     - “There are specific times for a few of her tablets—I'll give you a more detailed rundown after the round.”\n     - “Is the pred written up on the med chart? Yes, it’s charted.”\n   - High-risk meds (anticoagulants, insulin, etc.) do not need special labeling; any medication chat qualifies.\n\n22. assess_pathology\n   - Tag when lab tests, pathology, or microbiology are mentioned—planned, done, or pending.\n   - Examples:\n     - “He had bloods taken this morning… results need to be followed up.”\n     - “She had MRSA and VRE surveillance swabs.”\n     - “As a kidney patient she’s on the usual daily bloods… weekly urinalysis.”\n     - “Do we have the pathology forms in the chart? Yes, the forms are in the chart.”\n     - “Today we need to do bloods … random BGLs on pred.”\n   - Tests like blood glucose levels (BGLs), bloods, cultures, and swabs all count.\n\n23. assess_mobility\n   - Tag when mobility status or aids are described, or when orthostatic symptoms related to movement are discussed.\n   - Examples:\n     - “She’s self-caring and ambulant.”\n     - “Any dizziness when standing or going to the bathroom?” / “A little light-headed when I get up.” (Example 3: this should be tagged as assess_mobility.)\n     - “We’ll take it slow and use the call bell before you stand.”\n   - If mobility issues are connected to falls risk, tag both assess_mobility and bg_fall_risk when explicitly stated.\n\n24. assess_skin_integrity\n   - Tag when skin, wounds, or pressure areas are mentioned.\n   - Examples:\n     - “Surgical wound—site looks clean and is healing well.”\n     - “No pressure areas, skin intact.”\n     - “Dressing changed this morning.”\n\n--------------------------------\nRECOMMENDATIONS / PLANS\n--------------------------------\n\n25. rec_discharge_plan\n   - Tag when discharge timing, destination, or conditions are discussed.\n   - Examples:\n     - “Plan is to discharge home with community nursing once stable.”\n     - “Likely discharge tomorrow if bloods improve.”\n\n26. rec_actions\n   - Tag only for **critical, time-sensitive, or safety-related actions** and escalation thresholds.\n   - Examples:\n     - “Please escalate if HR drops below 35 or if she becomes symptomatic.”\n     - “Call the doctor if there is any chest pain or bleeding from the wound.”\n     - “If oxygen saturation falls below 90%, start O2 and call MET.”\n   - In Example 1, rec_actions is appropriate due to explicit escalation instructions (e.g., escalate if HR below threshold).\n   - Do NOT tag rec_actions for:\n     - Routine tasks,\n     - Standard monitoring without explicit escalation criteria.\n\n27. rec_plan\n   - Tag for ongoing or routine **care plan tasks** or follow-up actions (non-critical).\n   - Examples:\n     - “I’ll continue hourly Q-ADDS, monitor the GTN infusion, and keep a close eye on his fluid status and oxygen needs.” (Example 1: rec_plan.)\n     - “The plan for today is to continue monitoring her observations, follow up today’s blood results and the medical plan with Dr. Cox’s team, manage comfort—keep Mindy more upright…, and keep family informed.” (Example 2: rec_plan.)\n     - “Today we need to do bloods, lying/standing BPs, daily weight, continue strict fluid balance, random BGLs on pred, and I’ll come back to confirm those med timing specifics with you.” (Example 3: rec_plan.)\n   - Also use for routine actions like “collect swabs,” “continue wound care,” or “update charts.”\n\n--------------------------------\nKEY LESSONS FROM PRIOR EXAMPLES\n--------------------------------\n\nFrom the provided examples and feedback:\n\n- Example 1 (heart failure, transfer to CCU):\n  - Should include: introduction_patients, sit_diagnosis, sit_status, bg_history, bg_allergies, assess_obs, assess_devices, assess_fluid_balance, assess_infusions (GTN infusion), assess_medications, assess_monitoring (CCU-level monitoring), rec_plan, **and also** invitation, rec_patient_goals, rec_actions.\n  - Why:\n    - invitation: patient is engaged about ongoing monitoring and care; implicit encouragement to speak up.\n    - rec_patient_goals: checking if anything else is needed (“Let me know if you need anything else”).\n    - rec_actions: explicit escalation instructions related to GTN and HR (per feedback).\n\n- Example 2 (recurrent lung cancer, discomfort when lying flat):\n  - Correct categories include: introduction_patients, sit_diagnosis, bg_history, assess_pathology (bloods), assess_obs (QADDS=0), sit_status (“for further monitoring today”), assess_pain (chest pain), assess_mobility (“self-caring and ambulant”), assess_medications (“any meds or infusions… no”), rec_plan (described plan).\n  - Additionally must include: assess_devices (because of IV/infusion query), assess_infusions (discussion about infusions), invitation (“is that okay?”, “let us know what’s most comfortable”, “please buzz if…”), rec_patient_goals (“Anything else you need before I go?”), sit_events (“Mindy’s been uncomfortable lying down.”).\n\n- Example 3 (acute kidney injury, strict fluid chart):\n  - Correct categories include: introduction_patients, sit_diagnosis, bg_allergies, assess_fluid_balance (strict chart, measuring all intake/output), assess_medications (prednisolone, tablet timing), assess_pathology (bloods, BGLs, urinalysis), rec_plan.\n  - Should NOT include: assess_obs (no vitals, QADDS, or obs frequency mentioned).\n  - Must also include: assess_mobility (light-headed on standing, advice re standing), invitation (“is that okay?”, help with jugs/pan, buzzer use), rec_patient_goals (“Is there anything you need before we go?”).\n\n---------------------------\nPROCESS FOR EACH TRANSCRIPT\n---------------------------\n\n1. Read the full transcript to understand context and speakers (clinicians vs patient/carer).\n2. For each category, check for at least one clear, textual match to the criteria above.\n   - Be conservative; do not infer unstated items.\n   - However, if a statement clearly implies a category (e.g., light-headedness on standing → mobility), tag it.\n3. Build a list of all applicable category keys.\n4. Output **only** the list of category keys as a JSON-like array of strings, with no extra commentary.",
