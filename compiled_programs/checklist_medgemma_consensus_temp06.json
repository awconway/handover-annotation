    "instructions": "TASK\nYou will receive:\n- a clinical bedside handover transcript as plain text (may include speaker tags like [OUTGOING_NURSE], [INCOMING_NURSE], [PATIENT])\n\nOutput a Python-style list of category KEYS (exactly spelled as below) for categories that are explicitly addressed in the transcript.\n\nOUTPUT (very strict)\n- Return ONLY one line:\n  labels\n  ['key1','key2',...]\n- No extra text, no explanations.\n- Each key appears at most once.\n- Order: follow the category table order below (stable ordering).\n\nCORE RULE: EXPLICIT ONLY (NO INFERENCE)\nLabel a category only if it is clearly and directly evidenced by words in the transcript. Do not infer from context, typical workflows, or what is “probably true”.\n\nCATEGORIES (KEYS) AND EXACT CRITERIA\n\n1) Introductions / participation\n- introduction_clinicians\n  ONLY if clinicians introduce themselves to EACH OTHER by name/role such that the handover participants are explicitly identified (incoming and outgoing). \n  Not met if:\n  - only the incoming nurse introduces themself to the patient\n  - only one clinician is named without an explicit intro between clinicians\n\n- introduction_patients\n  If a clinician is introduced to the patient/carer (e.g., “This is Ben, your day nurse” OR “Hi I’m Evie, taking over your care” directed to patient). Naming just one clinician counts.\n\n- invitation\n  Only if patient/carer is explicitly asked/consented for bedside handover or invited to participate at the start (e.g., “Is it okay if we do handover here?”).\n  Not met by end-of-handover courtesy like “anything you need?”\n\n- rec_patient_goals\n  Only if patient/carer is asked about goals/preferences/concerns (including emotional readiness) AND they respond.\n  Not met by pure symptom checks (e.g., pain-only).\n\n2) Identification\n- id_check\n  ONLY if THREE identifiers are checked: (1) name AND (2) date of birth AND (3) MRN/URN/ID number.\n  If fewer than 3: DO NOT label.\n  Bed number/age/doctor/room ≠ identifier for this purpose.\n\n3) Situation (SIT)\n- sit_diagnosis\n  Primary diagnosis/reason for admission/procedure.\n\n- sit_events\n  Significant events/complications during admission/shift MUST be explicitly stated (e.g., “had a seizure”, “bled overnight”).\n  Do NOT label for:\n  - baseline findings at presentation (e.g., “CT confirmed hemorrhage”) unless framed as an event/complication\n  - implied deterioration\n  “No events/No acute changes” counts ONLY if explicitly stated as such.\n\n- sit_status\n  Current status/trajectory: awaiting theatre/tests/review, consent status, pre-op checklist completed, timing not confirmed, etc.\n\n4) Background (BG) (explicit mention only)\n- bg_history\n  Past medical history/comorbidities/social background (guardianship, living situation, supports).\n  Do NOT mislabel admission diagnosis as history.\n\n- bg_fall_risk\n  Only if “falls risk” (or equivalent) explicitly stated.\n\n- bg_pi_risk\n  Only if pressure injury risk explicitly stated (e.g., Waterlow score, “at risk of pressure injury”).\n\n- bg_allergies\n  Only if allergies are explicitly stated INCLUDING “No known drug allergies / NKDA” (this DOES count).\n\n- bg_acp\n  Only if ACD/ACP/DNAR/limitations of treatment explicitly stated.\n\n5) Assessment (A)\n- assess_obs\n  Vitals/observations or explicit stability statements (e.g., “vitals stable”, “Q-ADDS 0”, “SpO2 96% RA”, “GCS 15”).\n  Not met by future intent (“I’ll check obs later”).\n\n- assess_pain\n  Pain present/absent OR pain management discussed. A question + answer about pain counts.\n\n- assess_devices\n  Lines/devices mentioned OR explicitly checked/planned to be checked (IV cannula, IDC, drains, PICC, etc.). “I’ll check your IV” counts.\n\n- assess_monitoring\n  Specific critical monitoring/alarms beyond general obs (e.g., telemetry, continuous monitoring parameters). General “neuro obs hourly” is monitoring only if clearly described as a specific monitoring regimen; otherwise keep under assess_obs unless alarms/telemetry etc. are explicit.\n\n- assess_nutrition\n  Diet status/restrictions such as NBM/NPO/fasting/thickened fluids. NBM since a time counts.\n\n- assess_fluid_balance\n  Intake/output, fluid balance charting, targets/restrictions, hydration monitoring/diuresis plan.\n  NOTE: If the transcript explicitly mentions “food and fluid charts” or I/O amounts, this counts (do not miss it).\n\n- assess_infusions\n  Any infusion explicitly stated as running (heparin infusion, GTN infusion, IV fluids as infusion, etc.).\n\n- assess_medications\n  Medications discussed/reviewed (e.g., refused risperidone, antibiotics, regular meds, PRNs). (Infusions are also meds, but still label assess_infusions separately when applicable.)\n\n- assess_pathology\n  Pathology/imaging/tests results or pending repeats (bloods, ECG, CT, “declining blood tests”, “needs recheck K+”).\n  NOTE: Refusal/decline of blood tests is still explicit mention of pathology and counts.\n\n6) Recommendations (R)\n- rec_discharge_plan\n  Any discharge planning/destination/criteria/ready for discharge.\n\n- rec_actions\n  Specific time-critical tasks/escalations with clear action (call, contact, recheck urgently, escalate now).\n\n- rec_plan\n  Ongoing plan/follow-up steps (continue obs, keep NBM, liaise with theatre, delirium strategies, update GP if needed, continue pressure care, etc.).\n  NOTE: If ongoing care instructions are given (e.g., repositioning schedule, routine obs frequency), this counts as rec_plan.\n\nCOMMON ERROR AVOIDANCE (learned from prior examples)\n- Do NOT label introduction_clinicians unless clinicians explicitly introduce to each other; “Hi Lisa, I’m Evie” is introduction_patients only.\n- Do NOT label id_check unless name + DOB + MRN/URN all stated and checked.\n- Do NOT label sit_events for “CT confirmed diagnosis” or “no weakness noted”; those are assessment/context unless an explicit event/complication is stated.\n- Do NOT label bg_history for legal status/living situation unless explicitly stated (guardianship/social supports counts as bg_history when explicit).\n- Always label bg_allergies when “NKDA/no known allergies” is explicitly said.\n- Always label assess_pathology when blood tests/ECG/imaging are mentioned, even if refused or pending.\n- “Food and fluid charts commenced” supports assess_fluid_balance (and assess_nutrition if diet status is mentioned).\n- Ending courtesy (“press call bell”, “let me know if you need anything”) is not invitation or rec_patient_goals.\n\nReturn the final list of keys that are explicitly present.",
