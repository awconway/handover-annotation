    "instructions": "text\nTask\nYou will be given ONE field: `text`. It contains a clinical bedside handover transcript with speaker tags like “[OUTGOING_NURSE]: …”.\nYour job is to extract ONLY 1–3 “gold-like” uncertainty spans as verbatim, contiguous quotes from the transcript and assign EACH quote exactly ONE label from the allowed set.\n\nThis is HIGH-PRECISION / LOW-RECALL.\nGold annotations are SPARSE and sometimes “unexpected”: they may tag an earlier/smaller/less-obvious uncertainty and ignore other, stronger uncertainties later. You are scored by span overlap (IoU), so exact boundaries and label string correctness matter more than coverage.\n\nSTRICT output format\nReturn ONLY this JSON object (no markdown, no extra keys, no commentary):\n{\n  \"pred_spans\": [\n    {\"label\": \"<EXACT label string>\", \"quote\": \"<verbatim contiguous span>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nHard constraints (must follow)\n- Output TOTAL spans: 1–3 (total, not per label).\n- Quotes must be copied character-for-character from the transcript (punctuation, apostrophes, capitalization, spacing).\n- Quote must be a single contiguous span (do not stitch separate parts).\n- Do NOT include speaker tags (e.g., do not include “[OUTGOING_NURSE]:”).\n- The label MUST be exactly one of the allowed label strings below (no variants like “Hedging”, “Vagueness”, “Unknown fact”, “Indefinite timing” — those are WRONG).\n- If you truly need multiple labels for the same exact span, duplicate the same quote with different labels (rare; avoid).\n\nAllowed label set (use EXACT strings)\n1) Hedge / Probability Language\n2) Vague / Qualitative Expression\n3) Unknown fact / Explicit Lack of Knowledge\n4) Indefinite Timing\n5) Source Uncertainty\n6) Procedural Uncertainty\n7) Responsibility Uncertainty\n\nWhat “gold-like” means (critical quirks learned from evaluation)\n1) Don’t “spray” spans. Extra spans that don’t match gold severely hurt precision.\n   - If you find one very strong candidate, output ONLY 1 span.\n   - Add a 2nd/3rd only if it is also highly likely to be gold and clearly distinct.\n\n2) Gold often chooses an EARLIER uncertainty, not the most clinically salient one.\n   - Scan from the start; prefer the first strong gold-like uncertainty.\n\n3) Boundary discipline is everything (IoU scoring).\n   - Prefer short, tight spans that match what annotators typically select.\n   - Do not over-extend beyond the uncertain clause.\n   - End at a natural boundary (comma/period/dash segment) and avoid adding trailing rationale/plans.\n   - Example lesson: gold may be “Not really sure we haven't tried to get him up” WITHOUT a trailing period; punctuation mismatches can reduce IoU. Copy EXACTLY as in the transcript.\n\n4) Indefinite Timing is a top priority, but match the clause gold prefers.\n   - Strong candidates: “later today”, “this afternoon”, “overnight”, “this morning” (when used loosely), “recently”, “awaiting X”, “no confirmed time”, “see when they are coming”.\n   - Gold may tag the scheduling clause itself (e.g., “he’s booked for an angiogram later today.”) rather than a later “not sure of the exact time”.\n   - When timing uncertainty appears, prefer the booking/review timing clause (often starts with the clinician/doctor subject), not a later meta-comment about not knowing the exact time, unless that is the only timing uncertainty.\n\n5) “I think …” hedges: pick the one gold tends to tag.\n   - Gold may tag a practical resource/supply hedge (e.g., “I think they were short on gowns earlier”) rather than identity/role hedges (e.g., “who I think will be…”).\n   - When multiple “I think” occur, choose the more concrete, situational hedge that annotators are likely to mark.\n\n6) Be conservative with “Unknown fact / Explicit Lack of Knowledge”.\n   - Strong: “not sure…”, “don’t know…”, “haven’t heard…”, “not that I’m aware of…”.\n   - Prefer the exact phrase gold would mark (often the “not sure …” clause fragment), not a longer surrounding sentence.\n   - Don’t treat generic “awaiting/pending” as Unknown fact if it is primarily timing (then use Indefinite Timing) or if you already have a stronger gold-like span.\n\n7) Vague / Qualitative Expression\n   - Examples: “a bit…”, “pretty stable…”, “much the same…”, “around baseline…”, “a little off…”.\n   - Dataset quirk: gold sometimes tags a broader status/regimen clause rather than just the adjective; however, only select these if you lack a stronger Indefinite Timing / “I think” hedge / explicit “not sure”.\n\n8) Label choice rules (avoid common mistakes)\n   - Use “Indefinite Timing” for “later today / likely this afternoon / reviewing later today / awaiting transfer” type clauses (even if they contain “likely”).\n   - Use “Hedge / Probability Language” for probability/hedge that is not primarily timing (e.g., “I think…”, “most likely…”, “may need…”).\n   - Use “Vague / Qualitative Expression” for non-quantified descriptors (“a bit drowsy”).\n   - Do NOT invent label names: must match the 7 strings exactly.\n\nSpan selection procedure (do this every time)\n1) Read from the beginning and list only the best 1–3 candidates, prioritizing:\n   A) Indefinite Timing clauses (booking/review/awaiting + vague time),\n   B) “I think …” and other hedges that gold tends to tag,\n   C) Explicit lack of knowledge (“not sure …”),\n   D) Vague qualitative descriptors (only if needed).\n2) Choose the single best gold-like candidate and quote it with tight boundaries (no speaker tag, no extra surrounding text).\n3) Optionally add a 2nd/3rd only if you are confident they are also gold-like and not redundant.\n4) Final checks:\n   - 1–3 spans total\n   - exact allowed label string\n   - verbatim contiguous quote\n   - no speaker tags\n   - boundaries as tight as possible to maximize IoU\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.",
