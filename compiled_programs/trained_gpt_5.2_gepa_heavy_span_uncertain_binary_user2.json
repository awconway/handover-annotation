    "instructions": "text\nTask: Extract ONLY dataset-style “UNCERTAIN” spans from a clinical nursing/medical handover transcript.\n\nINPUT\n- One field: text\n- text is a transcript with speaker tags like [INCOMING_NURSE]:, [OUTGOING_NURSE]:, [DOCTOR]: etc.\n\nOUTPUT (ABSOLUTE — MUST FOLLOW)\n- Output ONLY a JSON-like list named pred_spans. No extra keys. No explanations. No markdown outside the required block.\n- The output must look exactly like:\n\npred_spans\n[\n  {\"label\": \"UNCERTAIN\", \"quote\": \"<verbatim contiguous substring from text>\"},\n  ...\n]\n\n- Each list item MUST be exactly:\n  {\"label\": \"UNCERTAIN\", \"quote\": \"<verbatim contiguous substring from text>\"}\n\nSPAN COPYING RULES (CRITICAL)\n- quote MUST be copied EXACTLY from text (identical case, punctuation, apostrophes, hyphens, and spacing).\n- quote MUST be a single contiguous substring from the input text (no stitching).\n- Return an empty list if no qualifying cues.\n\nEVALUATION/SCORING REALITY (OPTIMIZE FOR IoU)\n- Scoring uses character-span overlap (IoU). Boundaries matter more than “capturing the idea”.\n- Prefer spans that start exactly at the uncertainty cue word/phrase and stop as soon as the cue-meaning is complete.\n- Avoid adding extra clinical details, reasons, or follow-on plans.\n\nWHAT THIS DATASET ACTUALLY MARKS AS “UNCERTAIN” (LEARNED / DOMAIN-SPECIFIC)\nGold spans are often SHORT and cue-focused. The dataset frequently marks:\n1) Vague/indefinite near-future return timing phrases (HIGH VALUE)\n   - Minimal subject+verb timing fragment; usually STOP before purpose clause.\n   - Examples of gold-like targets:\n     - “We’ll be back shortly”\n     - “I’ll be back shortly”\n     - “be back shortly” (NOTE: gold may sometimes omit the subject; include exactly what appears in text and prefer including the full cue phrase present)\n     - “back later today”\n   - If the sentence continues (“…to do X”), usually STOP at the timing word (“shortly”, “later today”, etc.).\n\n2) Explicit hedges / probability / uncertainty cues (HIGH VALUE)\n   Extract the smallest clause containing the cue:\n   - “I think …”\n   - “I believe …”\n   - “might … / may …”\n   - “likely … / probably …”\n   - “I’m not sure … / unsure …”\n   - “need to double-check …”\n   - “I’ll have to check …”\n   Boundary: start at cue (“I think”, “might”, “I’m not sure”) and end at the end of that clause (often before extra explanation).\n\n3) Unconfirmed/To-be-booked arrangements WHEN FRAMED AS UNCONFIRMED (MODERATE VALUE)\n   - “all to be booked”\n   - “to be arranged”\n   - “I’m not sure if it’s been booked yet.”\n   Keep it minimal: extract only the unconfirmed booking fragment, not the whole surrounding plan narrative.\n\n4) Direct “unknown / to be confirmed” style phrases\n   - Minimal clause containing “unknown”, “unsure”, “not sure”, “to be confirmed”.\n\nWHAT NOT TO LABEL (COMMON FALSE POSITIVES IN THIS DATASET)\nDo NOT label these unless an explicit uncertainty cue (as above) is present in the same minimal clause:\n- “awaiting results / pending results / waiting for meds/results / last result isn’t in yet / keep an eye out for results”\n- “once they’re back”\n- “hopefully …”\n- Conditional plans framed as “if X then we’ll do Y” (do NOT label)\n- Diagnostic suspicion framed as “they suspect …”\n- PRN/as-needed medication language\n- Routine future intention statements without uncertainty cues:\n  - “I’ll check …”, “I’ll follow up …”, “I’ll chase …”, “I’ll review …”\n  (These are NOT uncertain unless phrased like “I’ll have to check…” / “need to double-check…” / “not sure…”)\n\nBOUNDARY CONTROL HEURISTICS (TO MATCH GOLD)\n- Prefer the shortest self-contained fragment that contains the uncertainty cue.\n- For “be back shortly” type cues, include the full timing phrase exactly as it appears; do NOT include “to do X”.\n- If multiple separate cues occur, output multiple separate spans (each must be contiguous and copied verbatim).\n- If you are unsure whether something is gold, be conservative: only extract when the cue matches the lists above.\n\nFINAL CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT\n1) Every quote is verbatim and contiguous.\n2) Each quote contains an explicit uncertainty cue or vague return timing cue.\n3) No extra context words after the cue clause that would reduce IoU.\n4) Output exactly pred_spans list and nothing else.",
