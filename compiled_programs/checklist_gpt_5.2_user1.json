Your job is to decide which handover categories from the fixed taxonomy have been explicitly addressed anywhere in the transcript, using the decision rules below.\n\nYou MUST follow the taxonomy keys exactly and output ONLY the required JSON.\n\n====================\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n====================\n- Output ONLY a JSON array of strings.\n- Each string must be exactly one taxonomy key (no new keys, no synonyms).\n- No prose, no commentary, no markdown outside the JSON.\n- Order: follow the taxonomy order shown below (be consistent).\n\n====================\nTASK METHOD (DO THIS)\n====================\n1) Read the whole transcript.\n2) For each taxonomy key, search for at least one explicit utterance that satisfies that category’s rule.\n3) Add the key if (and only if) it is clearly and explicitly addressed.\n4) Do NOT add keys for content that is merely implied, generic, or “normally done”.\n5) One utterance can satisfy multiple keys.\n\n====================\nTAXONOMY KEYS + STRICT DECISION RULES\n====================\n\nA) Introductions\n- introduction_clinicians\n  Label ONLY if ALL clinicians involved in the handover are introduced/identified to each other by name and/or role (both sides are clearly identified in the transcript). \n  If only one clinician introduces themself, or only one side is named, DO NOT label.\n- introduction_patients\n  Label when clinicians are introduced to the patient/carer OR the patient is explicitly told who the clinician(s) are (e.g., “I’m Hannah, your nurse today”, “This is the day nurse who’ll look after you”, “I’m just getting handover from Sam” said to patient/carer).\n\nB) invitation (patient/carer participation)\n- invitation\n  Label ONLY when staff explicitly invite the patient/carer to participate or seek permission to do bedside handover (e.g., “Is it okay if we do handover here?”, “Anything you want to add?”, “Can we do this together?”).\n  Do NOT label just because the patient speaks.\n\nC) Identification check\n- id_check\n  Label ONLY if THREE identifiers are checked: (1) name + (2) date of birth + (3) MRN/ID number.\n  If fewer than all three are checked, DO NOT label.\n\nD) Situation (SIT)\n- sit_diagnosis\n  Primary diagnosis / reason for admission is explicitly stated.\n- sit_events\n  Significant events/complications/deterioration/new major developments are explicitly stated (e.g., “now deteriorating”, “started on BiPAP overnight due to worsening”, “new diagnosis/metastases”).\n  Do NOT label for “no issues”, routine statements, or stable/no-change-only.\n- sit_status\n  Label when there is an explicit “current status/pending/awaiting/interim” state such as pending results, awaiting review/procedure/test, or a stated interim plan while waiting.\n  Examples that DO count: “bloods taken, results pending”, “awaiting review”, “ready for discharge”, “transitioned to oral meds”, “no longer requiring oxygen”, “completed IV antibiotics”.\n  Examples that DO NOT count: vague “continue current care” with no pending/awaiting element.\n\nE) Background (BG)\n- bg_history\n  Label ONLY for relevant past medical history/comorbidities or explicit social/living situation history (beyond the immediate situation), such as “lives in aged care”, major comorbidities mentioned as history, significant baseline context.\n  Do NOT label if the transcript only restates the presenting diagnosis/course without adding true background history.\n- bg_fall_risk\n  Label only if falls risk is explicitly stated.\n- bg_pi_risk\n  Label only if pressure injury risk is explicitly stated (e.g., Waterlow score, “at risk”, pressure-relieving mattress due to risk).\n- bg_allergies\n  Label only if allergies status is explicitly stated (including “NKDA”).\n- bg_acp\n  Label only if advanced care planning / resus status / goals-of-care documentation is explicitly mentioned.\n\nF) Assessment (ASSESS)\n- assess_obs\n  Label for vital signs/observations/Q-ADDS/early warning scores/afebrile etc.\n- assess_pain\n  Label for pain presence/score and/or pain management details.\n- assess_devices\n  Label for lines/drains/catheters/cannulas/IV access (including explicitly stating none).\n- assess_monitoring\n  Label ONLY for explicit ongoing monitoring modality/details beyond routine obs (e.g., “continuous ECG/telemetry”, “on continuous SpO2 monitoring”, alarms, neuro checks frequency).\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT label merely because a therapy/device is present (e.g., BiPAP settings) unless explicit monitoring/continuous monitoring instructions are stated.\n- assess_nutrition\n  Label for diet status/restrictions/intake noted (e.g., soft diet, NBM, % eaten).\n- assess_fluid_balance\n  Label for intake/output totals, urine output trends, fluid restriction, balance charts.\n- assess_infusions\n  Label for any IV fluids/infusions status, INCLUDING explicit statements of none (e.g., “NS at 100 mL/hr”, “no IV fluids running”, “no IV fluids required”).\n  NOTE: This is often missed—if IV fluids/infusions are mentioned as running OR explicitly not running, label it.\n- assess_medications\n  Label for medication lists, antibiotics, high-risk meds, or chart content.\n- assess_pathology\n  Label for labs/pathology tests and results/pending (FBC, U&E, cultures, lactate, etc.).\n- assess_mobility\n  Label for mobility status/ADLs/assistance/aids/physio recommendations.\n- assess_skin_integrity\n  Label for wounds/skin condition/pressure area checks, redness/breakdown, pressure care measures (when tied to skin state/care).\n\nG) Recommendations (REC)\n- rec_discharge_plan\n  Label for explicit discharge timing/destination/readiness/criteria (e.g., “ready for discharge back to nursing home”).\n- rec_actions\n  Label ONLY for explicit time-critical / must-do tasks being handed over as urgent or required actions (e.g., “call doctor now”, “chase urgently”, “insert cannula now”, “take lactate now”).\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT label for general non-urgent plans, routine continuation, or “I will do X” unless it is framed as must-do/time-critical escalation.\n- rec_plan\n  Label for ongoing plan for the shift/day that is not explicitly time-critical (e.g., continue obs, continue BiPAP, continue pressure care, continue monitoring charts, await review).\n- rec_patient_goals\n  Label when patient/carer goals/preferences/needs are explicitly elicited or confirmed (e.g., “anything you need?”, “does that sound right?”, “who should we contact?”, “would you like counselling?”, consent/preferences).\n\n====================\nCOMMON ERROR PREVENTION (BASED ON PRIOR MISTAKES)\n====================\n- Do not overuse rec_actions: only “urgent/must-do/escalate now” counts; routine next steps belong in rec_plan.\n- Do not miss sit_status when anything is pending/awaiting/transitioned/ready-for-discharge is explicitly stated.\n- Do not label assess_monitoring unless continuous/specific monitoring is explicitly described (device settings alone ≠ monitoring).\n- Do not miss assess_infusions when the transcript explicitly says IV fluids are running OR explicitly says none/no IV fluids required.\n\n====================\nFINAL OUTPUT\n====================\nReturn ONLY the JSON array of selected keys (taxonomy order), nothing else.",
