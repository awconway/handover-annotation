rely on spoken content, not tag format.\n\nOUTPUT (STRICT)\n- Output exactly ONE Python list of strings, e.g. ['sit_diagnosis','bg_allergies'].\n- No explanations, no extra text, no additional fields.\n- Each key appears at most once.\n- Keep ordering stable using the workflow order below (even if items appear later in the dialogue).\n\nABSOLUTE RULE: EXPLICIT TEXT ONLY (NO INFERENCE)\nLabel a category ONLY when the transcript directly states it.\n- Do NOT infer from context/clinical common sense.\n- Do NOT “upgrade” implied details into labels.\n- If something is only referenced as being “in the chart/documentation”, label only what is directly said (e.g., “fluid balance chart” → assess_fluid_balance; “documented in chart” alone adds nothing).\n\nWORKFLOW ORDER (use this order for final list)\n1) Introductions / invitation / patient goals prompt\n2) Identification checks\n3) Situation\n4) Background\n5) Assessment\n6) Recommendation\n\nCRITICAL MISLABEL PREVENTION (learned from errors)\n- invitation is COMMONLY MISSED:\n  - Count invitation when permission is sought for bedside handover (“is that okay?”, “okay if we…”) OR when the patient is directly invited to participate via direct symptom/feeling questions (“How are you feeling?”, “Any nausea?”, “Any pain?”, etc.).\n- rec_plan is COMMONLY MISSED:\n  - Label rec_plan whenever an explicit forward-looking plan/next steps is stated (“plan is to…”, “I’ll keep checking…”, “continue…”, “follow up…”, “await review/results”, “keep monitoring…”).\n- assess_pain is COMMONLY FALSE-POSITIVE:\n  - ONLY label assess_pain if pain/discomfort or pain assessment/analgesia-for-pain is explicitly mentioned.\n  - Do NOT label assess_pain for “comfortable” alone or general wellbeing questions unless pain/discomfort is explicitly referenced.\n- assess_pathology can be easy to miss:\n  - Label assess_pathology for ANY explicit mention of bloods/labs/pathology: “bloods”, “still for bloods”, “renal biopsy results pending”, “results back”, etc. (Biopsy results pending counts.)\n- rec_patient_goals can be easy to miss:\n  - Label rec_patient_goals when patient/carer is asked for needs/preferences/goals/concerns or invited to add anything (“Do you need anything?”, “Anything you want to add?”, “Any concerns?”, etc.).\n\nCATEGORY KEYS (with edge-case rules)\n\nINTRODUCTIONS\n- introduction_clinicians:\n  - ONLY if clinicians introduce themselves to EACH OTHER by name/role (both sides explicitly identified).\n  - NOT if only one clinician name appears or only patient is introduced to staff.\n- introduction_patients:\n  - Count if a clinician introduces self (or another staff member) to the patient/carer (“I’m X, your nurse…” / “This is Y…”).\n- invitation:\n  - Count if permission for bedside handover is sought (“if that’s okay?”, “is it okay if we…”).\n  - ALSO count when the patient is directly invited into participation during handover via direct questions about symptoms/feelings (e.g., “How are you feeling?”, “Any nausea?”, “Any pain?”).\n- rec_patient_goals:\n  - ONLY if patient/carer is asked for needs/preferences/goals/concerns or invited to add anything (“Anything you want to add?”, “Do you need anything right now?”).\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n- id_check:\n  - ONLY if ALL THREE are checked/stated/confirmed: (1) name, (2) date of birth, AND (3) ID/MRN/URN number.\n  - Name + DOB/age is NOT enough.\n  - “Checking wristband” without stating all three does NOT count.\n\nSITUATION\n- sit_diagnosis:\n  - Primary reason for admission/diagnosis explicitly stated.\n- sit_events:\n  - ONLY for significant events/complications/incidents that occurred (fall, arrest, acute deterioration, urinary retention, vomiting as an event if clearly described as happening during shift, failed procedure attempt, etc.).\n  - Do NOT use for routine tests done, imaging performed, or “reviewed by team” unless explicitly framed as an incident/complication.\n- sit_status:\n  - Current status explicitly stated (stable/unstable/symptomatic, etc.) OR explicitly awaiting/scheduled/for a procedure/test/review (“awaiting biopsy results”, “for biopsy”, “Dr will review later”, “on 2‑hourly obs”, “no routine obs”, “in isolation”).\n\nBACKGROUND\n- bg_history:\n  - ONLY if past medical history/comorbidities OR explicit psychosocial/social context is stated as background (e.g., “type 2 diabetes”, “COPD”, interpreter needs, family support).\n  - Do NOT label just because the admission diagnosis is stated; it must be framed as PMH/social background.\n- bg_fall_risk:\n  - ONLY if “falls risk” explicitly stated.\n- bg_pi_risk:\n  - ONLY if pressure injury risk explicitly mentioned OR explicit PI prevention/risk management described:\n    - “pressure‑relieving mattress”, “repositioned 2‑hourly”, “pressure area care” → bg_pi_risk.\n- bg_allergies:\n  - Any allergy status stated, including “NKDA/no known drug allergies”.\n- bg_acp:\n  - Goals-of-care / resus status / advanced care planning explicitly mentioned (palliative/comfort measures only/not for resus).\n\nASSESSMENT\n- assess_obs:\n  - Any vital signs/observations/EWS (Q‑ADDS/QADDS) OR explicit plan about observations (“obs stable”, “continue obs”, “no routine observations”).\n- assess_pain:\n  - ONLY if pain/discomfort/headache/chest tightness is explicitly mentioned or analgesia explicitly for pain/discomfort.\n- assess_devices:\n  - ONLY if a device/line/access is explicitly named (IV cannula, IDC, drain, etc.).\n  - Oxygen delivery counts ONLY when clearly described as equipment/method in use (e.g., “on 2 L nasal prongs”).\n- assess_monitoring:\n  - ONLY if continuous monitoring explicitly stated (telemetry/continuous cardiac monitoring).\n  - Routine obs schedules do NOT count.\n- assess_nutrition:\n  - Diet status/restrictions/intake (NBM, tolerating diet, etc.).\n- assess_fluid_balance:\n  - ONLY if explicitly tracked with:\n    - “fluid balance chart”, OR explicit intake/output numbers, OR fluid restriction/daily weights.\n  - “monitor fluids” alone is NOT enough.\n- assess_infusions:\n  - ONLY if a continuous IV infusion is explicitly running/titrated (“IV fluids running at 100 mL/hr”).\n  - If explicitly says “no IV fluids running”, do NOT label.\n  - Intermittent IV meds are NOT infusions unless stated continuous/running.\n- assess_medications:\n  - Any medication mentioned as given/ordered/charted (including PRNs, “as charted”, antiemetics, antibiotics, etc.).\n- assess_pathology:\n  - ONLY if labs/bloods/pathology mentioned (ordered/pending/results) OR samples sent with results/pending.\n  - ECG alone is NOT pathology.\n  - “Still for bloods” and “awaiting biopsy results” count.\n- assess_mobility:\n  - Mobility/assistance/ambulation/aids OR repositioning/turning discussed.\n- assess_skin_integrity:\n  - ONLY if skin/wound/dressing/pressure area STATUS described (“skin intact”, “no redness”, “dressing intact”).\n  - PI prevention alone without skin status → bg_pi_risk only.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n- rec_discharge_plan:\n  - Discharge timing/destination/criteria explicitly discussed.\n- rec_actions:\n  - ONLY urgent/time‑critical escalation or immediate critical actions with explicit urgency (“call rapid response now”, “urgent review”, “press call bell straight away if…” can count ONLY if framed as urgent escalation instruction).\n- rec_plan:\n  - Any explicit forward plan/next steps (“continue…”, “follow up…”, “await review/results”, “monitor…”, “keep checking obs…”).\n  - If any “plan is…” statement appears, almost always include rec_plan.\n\nFINAL CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT\n- Do I have invitation if either (a) permission for handover OR (b) patient asked how they feel/any symptoms?\n- Did I avoid assess_pain unless pain/discomfort explicitly stated?\n- Did I include rec_plan when any future action is stated?\n- Did I include assess_pathology when bloods/labs/biopsy results are mentioned?\n- Did I include rec_patient_goals when asked “anything to add”/“need anything”?\n\nReturn ONLY the Python list of keys, in workflow order.",
