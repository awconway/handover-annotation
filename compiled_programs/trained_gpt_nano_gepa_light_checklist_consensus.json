    "instructions": "text\nYou will be given ONE clinical bedside handover transcript as plain text with speaker tags (e.g., [INCOMING_NURSE], [OUTGOING_NURSE], [PATIENT], [CARER], [DOCTOR], etc.). Your job is to output which handover categories are ACTUALLY and EXPLICITLY addressed in that transcript.\n\nYou must be strict: label ONLY what is clearly said in words in the transcript. Do not infer, do not assume “usual practice,” and do not “upgrade” vague statements into categories. If it’s borderline, leave it out.\n\n================\nOUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)\n================\nReturn ONLY a Python-style list of strings, e.g.:\n['sit_diagnosis', 'assess_medications']\n- Use ONLY keys from the provided category table.\n- No prose, no explanations, no extra keys, no duplicates.\n- Order does not matter, but do not repeat items.\n\n================\nWORKING METHOD (DO THIS MENTALLY BEFORE FINAL LIST)\n================\n1) Scan the transcript line-by-line.\n2) For each candidate label, find an exact quote that satisfies the label’s rule.\n3) Final self-check: if you cannot point to an exact phrase, REMOVE the label.\n4) Prefer under-inclusion to over-inclusion.\n\n================\nGLOBAL DECISION RULES\n================\nA) Explicit-only rule\n- Add a label only when an explicit statement or explicit question directly covers that category.\n- DO give credit for explicit questions even if not answered (e.g., “Any allergies?” counts as bg_allergies even if unknown).\n\nB) Avoid over-labelling / don’t “upgrade”\n- “Stable” alone does NOT count as assess_obs unless explicitly tied to observations/vitals (e.g., “observations stable”, “vitals stable”, “Q-ADDS 0”, or numbers).\n- Mentioning that a team will “review meds” is NOT assess_medications unless actual medications are explicitly discussed (named meds, doses, charting, administration/refusal, etc.).\n- Mentioning “septic workup pending” or “blood cultures sent/pending” counts as assess_pathology (because it’s pathology/testing), but cognitive screening scores (e.g., 4AT) do NOT.\n- Do not label bg_history unless comorbidities/past conditions are explicitly stated (e.g., CKD, dementia). Do not treat legal/social facts as history.\n\nC) Plan vs Action (important)\n- rec_plan: any stated next steps / intended ongoing care (routine or non-urgent). Examples: “continue monitoring,” “await review,” “follow up bloods,” “keep NBM,” “prep for colonoscopy,” “doctor will review later.”\n- rec_actions: ONLY urgent/critical must-do tasks explicitly framed as urgent/critical or time-sensitive escalation (e.g., “call MET now,” “must go to CT immediately,” “notify doctor urgently”). If it’s routine continuation, label rec_plan, not rec_actions.\n\n================\nCATEGORY-SPECIFIC RULES (COMMON PITFALLS)\n================\n\nINTRODUCTIONS\n- introduction_clinicians:\n  ONLY when clinicians introduce/identify themselves to EACH OTHER (clinician-to-clinician).\n  NOT when introducing the incoming nurse to the patient.\n- introduction_patients:\n  When clinicians identify themselves to the patient/carer OR introduce the incoming clinician to the patient/carer (e.g., “I’m Alex, I’ll be looking after you”; “This is Evie, she’s taking over”).\n- invitation:\n  ONLY when patient/carer is explicitly asked permission to do bedside handover / be present / participate\n  (e.g., “Is it okay if we do bedside handover?” “We’re going to handover here if that’s okay.”).\n  NOTE: “please jump in if you feel up to it” / “feel free to contribute” is encouragement, not permission, unless it explicitly asks okay/consent.\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n- id_check:\n  ONLY if ALL THREE are explicitly checked: (1) name AND (2) DOB AND (3) URN/MRN/ID number.\n  Name + DOB only is NOT enough. ID band confirmation without an ID number is NOT enough.\n\nSITUATION\n- sit_diagnosis:\n  Primary diagnosis/reason for admission/presenting problem/planned procedure.\n- sit_events:\n  Significant events/complications during admission/shift explicitly described as discrete events (fall, seizure overnight, hypotensive episode). “No acute changes/events” counts only if clearly referring to such events.\n- sit_status:\n  Workflow status: awaiting tests/review/theatre, referral pending, scheduled procedure, on theatre list, pending consent, NBM pending procedure, discharge-ready, etc.\n\nBACKGROUND\n- bg_history:\n  Comorbidities/past history explicitly stated (e.g., chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis).\n  Do NOT label this for guardianship/POA/no family/social facts.\n- bg_allergies / bg_fall_risk / bg_pi_risk:\n  ONLY if explicitly stated (e.g., “NKDA”, “falls risk”, “pressure injury risk/Waterlow”).\n- bg_acp:\n  ONLY if ACP/goals-of-care/resus status/limitations of treatment/ACP documentation explicitly mentioned\n  (e.g., “for full resuscitation”, “DNR”, “not for ICU”).\n\nASSESSMENT\n- assess_obs:\n  Requires explicit observation content:\n  - vitals numbers (BP/HR/RR/Temp/SpO2), OR\n  - explicit “observations/vitals stable”, OR\n  - Q-ADDS score, OR\n  - GCS/neuro obs described as observation content (score or explicit monitoring of neuro obs).\n  IMPORTANT: If the transcript says “observations were taken” (even with unknown results), that still counts as assess_obs because obs are explicitly discussed.\n  NOT satisfied by only “I’ll do obs later” with no obs content.\n- assess_pain:\n  ONLY if pain is explicitly assessed or discussed as pain (e.g., “How is your pain?” “paracetamol for pain”).\n- assess_devices:\n  ONLY if a device/line/tube/catheter/drain/oxygen device is explicitly mentioned (e.g., “IV cannula”, “IDC”, “NGT”, “on nasal prongs”).\n  Do NOT infer devices from “IV antibiotics/IV fluids” unless a line/cannula is explicitly stated.\n- assess_monitoring:\n  ONLY for special/continuous monitoring beyond routine obs (telemetry, continuous monitoring, 1:1, specialling, alarms).\n  Do NOT label this for “keep an eye on” or routine/ongoing obs/neuro checks unless explicitly framed as special monitoring (e.g., “1:1”, “continuous telemetry”).\n- assess_nutrition:\n  Diet/intake status explicitly stated (NBM, fasting, poor intake, refusing meals, diet order).\n- assess_fluid_balance:\n  ONLY if I/O or fluid balance is explicitly discussed (input/output totals, urine output, strict I&Os, daily weights, “drinking well/poorly” as intake).\n  Do NOT label this just because IV fluids are running.\n- assess_infusions:\n  ONLY if an active infusion is explicitly mentioned with being run/ongoing (e.g., IV fluids at a rate, heparin infusion).\n  IV antibiotics alone are medications unless explicitly described as an infusion/continuous drip.\n- assess_medications:\n  ONLY when medications are explicitly discussed (names, doses, charted/administered/refused/PRN given).\n  “Doctors will review meds” without any medication detail does NOT count.\n- assess_pathology:\n  Lab/pathology tests or results/pending bloods explicitly stated (electrolytes, BGL, “blood cultures taken/pending”, “septic workup pending”, “bloods pending/declining blood tests”).\n- assess_mobility:\n  Mobility status/assistance/aids explicitly stated (ambulant, self-caring, needs assistance).\n- assess_skin_integrity:\n  Pressure areas, wounds, dressings, PI care explicitly stated.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n- rec_discharge_plan:\n  Discharge explicitly discussed (ready for discharge, destination, paperwork).\n- rec_plan:\n  Any explicit ongoing plan/next steps (including “awaiting psych review”, “prep for procedure”, “continue obs”, “keep NBM”).\n- rec_actions:\n  ONLY explicitly urgent/critical tasks that must happen now / escalation.\n- rec_patient_goals:\n  ONLY when patient/carer is explicitly asked about goals/preferences/needs that guide care.\n  Include if the nurse asks about immediate needs/preferences (e.g., “Is there anything you need—food, water, blanket?”) or care preferences/concerns.\n  Do NOT label for generic wrap-up like “Anything else?” unless it clearly seeks patient preferences/needs.\n\n================\nFINAL SELF-CHECK\n================\nBefore outputting the list:\n- For every label you plan to include, ensure there is a specific phrase in the transcript that directly matches the rule.\n- If not, remove it.\n\nReturn ONLY the Python-style list of labels.",
