    "instructions": "You are performing IoU-sensitive span extraction from ONE field `text` that contains a bedside clinical handover transcript with speaker tags like “[OUTGOING_NURSE]:”.\n\nTASK\nReturn the dataset’s gold-standard “clinical uncertainty” spans as a JSON array of objects:\n[{\"label\":\"...\",\"quote\":\"...\"}]\n- `quote` must be a VERBATIM, CONTIGUOUS substring from `text`\n- Do NOT include speaker tags in the quote\n- Exactly ONE label per quote\n- No extra keys, no commentary, no markdown outside the JSON array\n\nLABEL SET (exact strings)\n1) Hedging\n2) Vagueness\n3) Unknown fact\n4) Indefinite timing\n5) Source uncertainty\n6) Procedural uncertainty\n7) Responsibility uncertainty\n\nCRITICAL: WHAT THE GOLD ACTUALLY REWARDS (from scoring feedback)\nThe gold standard is VERY SPARSE and is heavily biased toward “VAGUE / REASSURING CLINICAL STATUS” language. It often ignores many other plausible uncertainties (pending tests, awaiting review, plans, bookings, consults, etc.).\nTherefore:\n- Always hunt for Vagueness first and extract it, even if it feels “not uncertainty”.\n- Be conservative about extracting procedural/plan-related items; they often score as false positives.\n\nHIGHEST PRIORITY: VAGUENESS (extract these whenever present)\nExtract minimal clauses that reassure / summarize status without precise measurement, e.g.:\n- “He’s stable.” / “Otherwise … stable.” / “observations are stable.”\n- “within normal limits”\n- “no changes”\n- “no concerns” / “no issues”\n- “tolerating …” / “mobilising …” / “doing well”\n- patient reassurance: “I’m fine.” / “I’m good.” / “I’m okay.”\n- “leave you in good hands” style reassurance MAY be considered vagueness if it’s about patient being okay/settled; prefer patient-condition vagueness.\n\nIMPORTANT: GOLD OFTEN CONTAINS MULTIPLE VAGUENESS SPANS PER TRANSCRIPT\nDo NOT stop after finding one. Extract each distinct short vagueness clause (split into multiple outputs) when they occur in different places, including patient lines like “No, I’m fine/okay/good.”\n\nBOUNDARY RULES (to improve IoU)\nIoU scoring penalizes extra words. Make spans TIGHT and match the clause form likely in gold:\n- Prefer including the cue word(s) and the smallest governed content.\n- If the text says “No new injuries noted.” the minimal span may be exactly that clause.\n- If the text says “Observations have remained within normal limits.” prefer that whole clause over extracting only “within normal limits” (gold often keeps the full clause).\n- If the text says “He was reviewed by the medical team and remains hemodynamically stable.” gold may prefer the fuller clause around “stable” rather than only “remains hemodynamically stable.” Include the immediate lead-in if it is part of the same clause and still short (e.g., “was reviewed by the medical team and remains hemodynamically stable.”).\n- Keep punctuation as in the source when it is contiguous (periods, commas).\n\nLOWER PRIORITY TYPES (extract only if very explicit and clinically central; keep extremely tight)\nB) Hedging: “I think/appears/likely/probably” + clinical content.\nC) Unknown fact: “don’t know/not sure/can’t recall” about clinical facts (allergies, history, etc.).\nD) Indefinite timing: “later today/tomorrow/overnight/at the moment” ONLY when tied to a clinical plan/status and clearly relevant.\nE) Source uncertainty: attribution (“team said…”) + the attributed clinical content.\nF) Procedural uncertainty: “awaiting results/waiting for review/pending” — NOTE: these commonly do NOT match gold; avoid unless unavoidable and central.\nG) Responsibility uncertainty: “needs to be done” with unclear owner.\n\nANTI-OVEREXTRACTION RULE\nIf the only uncertainty you can find is procedural (awaiting results, will review later, to be determined), usually SKIP it unless there is no vagueness anywhere. When in doubt: stay sparse and focus on vagueness/reassurance.\n\nOUTPUT RULES\n- Return ONLY the JSON array.\n- If nothing matches, return [].\n- Each quote must be exactly copied from `text` (case, apostrophes, spacing).\n- Never stitch discontiguous text.",
