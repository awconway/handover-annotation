    "instructions": "text\nYou are given one input field: `text`, a transcript of a clinical bedside handover (multi-speaker dialogue with tags like [OUTGOING_NURSE], [INCOMING_NURSE], [DOCTOR], [PATIENT], etc.).\n\nGOAL\nDecide which handover categories (keys) from the provided key list are explicitly addressed in the transcript, using a VERY CONSERVATIVE standard: label ONLY when the transcript contains clear, direct evidence that matches the category definition. Do not infer, “read between the lines,” or apply “typical handover” expectations.\n\nOUTPUT (STRICT)\nReturn ONLY:\nlabels = ['key1','key2',...]\n- Python-style list of strings named exactly `labels`\n- No extra text, no explanations\n- Each key appears at most once\n- Order should be stable/readable: Situation → Background/alerts → Assessment → Recommendations → Admin/other (if any)\n\nGLOBAL DECISION RULES (conservative)\n1) If a label requires a specific element (e.g., an invitation, a trigger, a test name, a fluid-balance metric), it must appear in words. Otherwise omit.\n2) Prefer omission over over-labelling.\n3) Do not “upgrade” routine content into higher-acuity categories (common failure modes: sit_events, rec_actions, assess_obs, bg_history, rec_discharge_plan).\n\nKEY DEFINITIONS & CRITICAL EDGE CASES\n\nA) Patient involvement / communication\n1) `invitation` (VERY specific)\nLabel ONLY if staff explicitly invite the patient/carer to participate in the handover OR to ask questions/comment as part of wrapping up handover.\nCounts (examples):\n- “Is it okay if we do bedside handover with you?”\n- “Are you happy with the handover?”\n- “Any questions before we finish?” / “Do you want to add anything?”\nDoes NOT count:\n- Routine symptom checks (“Any pain?”, “How’s your breathing?”)\n- Comfort/needs checks (“Do you need anything right now?”) unless explicitly framed as handover participation/questions.\n\n2) Introductions (strict)\n- `introduction_clinicians`: ONLY if ALL clinicians in the handover introduce themselves to each other with name/role (both directions if two clinicians). Partial/one-sided greetings do NOT count.\n- `introduction_patients`: Label if incoming clinician(s) are introduced to the patient/carer clearly (e.g., “I’m Priya, I’ll be looking after you today” OR “This is Evie; she’ll be looking after you today.”)\n\nB) Situation vs background vs current status (keep separate; do not blur)\n- `sit_diagnosis`: reason for admission / presenting problem / primary diagnosis (e.g., “came in with pneumonia”).\n- `sit_events`: significant acute event/complication that occurred during stay (e.g., fall, deterioration, pneumothorax after procedure). \n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT label `sit_events` for:\n  - Simply describing the presenting problem or initial reaction that is part of admission story (e.g., “accidentally prescribed penicillin and developed a rash” when told as the allergy context may be background/alert content unless clearly framed as an in-hospital acute event/complication timeline).\n  - Routine progress statements (“better than yesterday”, “afebrile today”) without a distinct acute adverse event.\n- `sit_status`: explicit current state/phase with pending actions/orders or “awaiting/scheduled/for” elements (e.g., “awaiting placement”, “scheduled for dialysis tomorrow”, “for diabetic educator tomorrow”). Must contain a clear “current status + pending/next” component, not just diagnosis alone.\n- `bg_history`: past medical history/comorbidities/baseline function/social history NOT merely restating the presenting complaint.\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT label `bg_history` for non-PMH items such as:\n  - placement/discharge destination issues (that belongs to `sit_status` and/or `rec_discharge_plan` only if actual discharge planning is explicit)\n  - allergies (use `bg_allergies`)\n  - “self-caring and ambulant” (mobility domain, not PMH)\n  - “pleasant/demanding/aggressive” unless explicitly framed as background risk/alert (and there is no separate key here unless it creates explicit escalation instructions under recommendations).\n\nC) Assessment domains (label only with substantive explicit content)\n- `assess_pain`: pain discussed with clinical management (pain score or analgesia/plan). \n  Do NOT label for a bare symptom check (“Any pain?”) or patient denial without a pain plan.\n- `assess_mobility`: substantive mobility status/needs (independent vs assisted, supervision, aids, explicit ambulant/self-caring statements).\n- `assess_obs`: vital signs/observations content such as BP/HR/RR/sats/temperature, “obs stable”, QADDS/early warning score, or an explicit obs schedule.\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT label `assess_obs` for isolated task-like statements that are not clearly “observations/vitals,” e.g.:\n  - “do lying and standing blood pressures this afternoon” by itself is not necessarily “obs stable/plan” content unless clearly framed as observations monitoring; treat it as a routine task under `rec_plan` unless additional obs context is present.\n- `assess_monitoring`: ONLY for continuous/critical monitoring (telemetry, ICU alarms), not routine obs.\n- `assess_devices`: lines/drains/cannula/IDC/chest drain/AV graft/pacemaker mentioned as present/inserted/requested.\n- `assess_medications`: ONLY if medication management is explicitly discussed beyond trivial negation; examples: listing multiple active meds with a plan to administer/continue, “regular meds/PRNs/next due,” charting changes.\n  Note: analgesia-only discussion should be captured under `assess_pain`; add `assess_medications` only if broader med management is clearly discussed.\n- `assess_infusions`: ONLY continuous IV infusions (maintenance fluids running, insulin infusion, IV antibiotic infusion). Single IV doses are NOT infusions.\n- `assess_fluid_balance`: ONLY if explicit fluid balance elements appear: input/output totals, “fluid balance,” urine output totals, restriction targets (e.g., “1.2 L restriction”), daily weights, or “balance chart.” Mention of “double-check I/O” or “fluid restriction” qualifies.\n- `assess_nutrition`: diet type/restrictions/intake/tolerance (e.g., “tolerated diet well”).\n- `assess_pathology`: tests/imaging/labs with named tests and/or results/orders (e.g., “CT ordered,” “Hb 98”). “Under investigation” without specific tests does NOT count.\n- `assess_skin_integrity`: pressure areas/ulcers/mattress/skin checks.\n\nD) Alerts / risks\n- `bg_allergies`: ONLY if explicitly stated (including NKDA).\n- `bg_fall_risk`, `bg_pi_risk`: ONLY if explicitly stated as such.\n\nE) Recommendations (separate routine plan vs urgent escalation)\n- `rec_plan`: routine tasks/next steps (continue/wean O2 as tolerated, repeat obs, check BGLs, give ordered meds, follow-up referrals/appointments, confirm bookings, reinforce bracelet, daily weights, fluid restriction education).\n- `rec_actions`: ONLY if explicit urgent/critical escalation triggers or immediate escalation instructions are stated (e.g., “call registrar now,” “rapid response if…,” “escalate if sats drop below X,” “escalate if safety is a concern”).\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT label `rec_actions` for:\n  - general “press call bell if worse” safety-netting without explicit escalation language/criteria\n  - routine “monitor/keep an eye on” statements unless explicitly framed as escalation/urgent response.\n- `rec_discharge_plan`: ONLY if actual discharge planning is explicitly discussed (e.g., “discharge today,” “expected discharge date,” “waiting for placement as discharge destination planning” ONLY counts if explicitly framed as discharge/placement planning; “awaiting placement” alone is `sit_status`, not automatically discharge planning).\n- `rec_patient_goals`: ONLY if patient goals/preferences are explicitly elicited or stated in a goals context (e.g., “He wants to go home today”).\n\nF) ID checking\n- `id_check`: ONLY if THREE identifiers are checked (name + DOB + MRN/ID number). Name alone or name + DOB is insufficient. Wristband check without all three stated is insufficient.\n\nFINAL SELF-CHECK (apply before producing labels)\n- Remove any label that depends on inference.\n- Specifically re-check common overcalls:\n  1) `bg_history` (only PMH/baseline function/social history)\n  2) `sit_events` (only true acute complications/events during stay, clearly framed)\n  3) `rec_actions` (only explicit escalation/urgent triggers, not generic call-bell advice)\n  4) `assess_obs` (must clearly be vitals/obs content; do not label for a single orthostatic BP task unless framed as obs monitoring)\n  5) `rec_discharge_plan` (only explicit discharge planning, not mere “awaiting placement”)\n\nReturn only:\nlabels = [...]",
