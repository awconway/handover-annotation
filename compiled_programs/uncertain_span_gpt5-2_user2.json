Only extract if you have strong reason it’s gold-like; otherwise skip.\n\n2) Vague / Qualitative Expression\n- Imprecise qualitative descriptors that are clinically salient AND appear in the dataset’s gold style:\n  - “A bit sore” (minimal).\n  - Potentially: “almost two weeks” type duration vagueness (conservative).\n- Avoid over-tagging: many “mild …” findings were not gold in feedback.\n\n3) Unknown fact / Explicit Lack of Knowledge\n- Explicit: “I’m not sure”, “don’t know”, “no updates yet”, “unable to confirm”.\n- Extract only the minimal not-knowing clause.\n\n4) Indefinite Timing (most important)\n- Extract minimal clauses for:\n  - “awaiting … to review”\n  - “awaiting theatre—likely this afternoon.”\n  - “will reassess … tomorrow.”\n  - “review again tomorrow.”\n  - “I’ll be back shortly”\n  - Similar “scheduled/booked/planning to …” future-event clauses when phrased as a plan/time.\n- Keep punctuation exactly as in the transcript when it is part of the gold-like span (e.g., include the final period if the phrase in text includes it and it cleanly closes the clause).\n\n5) Source Uncertainty\n- Second-hand attribution: “reportedly”, “was told”, “per patient”, “as per the team”, etc.\n- Extract the minimal attribution phrase.\n\n6) Procedural Uncertainty\n- Conditional/contingent logic: “depending on…”, “we’ll see how … goes”, “if X then …”.\n- Dataset caution: do not tag generic politeness/permission (“if that’s okay”) as procedural uncertainty.\n\n7) Responsibility Uncertainty\n- Unclear ownership: “needs review”, “needs to be checked” with no owner.\n\nBOUNDARY RULES (GOLD-LIKE SPAN SELECTION)\n1) Prefer the gold’s “minimal complete phrase”, not the whole sentence.\n2) Do NOT attach downstream explanations or tasks.\n   - Especially for timing: stop at the timing clause (“I’ll be back shortly”; “review again tomorrow.”).\n3) Do NOT under-shoot when gold includes the full minimal timing clause.\n   - Example: include “is currently awaiting theatre—likely this afternoon.” rather than only “likely this afternoon”.\n4) Keep single uncertainty constructions together.\n   - Example: “awaiting X to review” stays intact as one span.\n5) If a phrase contains multiple vague descriptors, output only the fragment that matches gold style (e.g., “A bit sore”, not “A bit sore and tired,”).\n6) If a sentence has multiple facts, extract ONLY the uncertainty clause, not adjacent certain facts (e.g., vitals, stable observations).\n\nFINAL OUTPUT CHECKLIST\n- Output is a JSON list only.\n- Each label is exactly one of the 7 allowed strings.\n- Each quote is an exact contiguous substring from `text`.\n- Conservative: if low confidence, omit.",
