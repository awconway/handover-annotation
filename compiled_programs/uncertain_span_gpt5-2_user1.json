When you see a known pattern, copy the whole gold-favored clause, not just the trigger word.\n\nGOLD-FAVORED PATTERNS TO EXTRACT (high priority)\n1) Stable / normal-range vitals phrasing → \"Vague / Qualitative Expression\"\n   Extract the full minimal clause that gold tends to take, e.g.:\n   - \"Observations are stable.\" (include trailing period if present)\n   - \"He’s otherwise stable and for monitoring.\" (often includes the continuation)\n   - \"Blood pressure has been within normal range for him\"\n   - \"vitals stable,\" (note the trailing comma can be part of gold)\n   Keep the subject + “stable/within normal range” together. Don’t truncate to just “stable”.\n\n2) Monitoring / close monitoring / ongoing phrasing → \"Vague / Qualitative Expression\"\n   Gold may include a leading colon from the transcript turn, e.g.:\n   - \": He remains under close monitoring\"\n   Include the leading \":\" if it is contiguous in the text.\n\n3) “Given / started / running / completed” care-delivery vagueness → \"Vague / Qualitative Expression\"\n   Gold in this dataset often marks these as vague even though they sound factual. Prefer extracting these exact compact fragments:\n   - \"I’ve completed his initial observations\"\n   - \"He’s started on oral antibiotics\"\n   - \"He’s on ongoing IV fluids at\" (yes, gold may stop at “at”)\n   - \"IV at 125 mL/hr running\"\n   - \"oral antibiotics\" (can be gold as a very short fragment)\n   Boundary rule: match gold-like truncations; do NOT append extra details (rates, outcomes, “with good effect”, etc.) unless the phrase itself in text is exactly part of the compact fragment above.\n\n4) Indefinite timing / not scheduled exactly → \"Indefinite Timing\"\n   Extract the combined clause when timing uncertainty is expressed across adjacent words, e.g.:\n   - \"Sometime this afternoon there is no exact time yet.\"\n   Prefer one combined span instead of splitting into two.\n   Also extract:\n   - \"next dose can be given after his lunch.\"\n   (Include the trailing period if present.)\n\n5) Explicit unknown/unclear documentation facts → \"Unknown fact / Explicit Lack of Knowledge\"\n   Extract compact clauses with “not confirmed yet”, “unknown”, “unclear”, “need to clarify”, especially about charting/allergies/history. Keep it as one natural clause.\n\n6) Responsibility/task-due items (only when clearly a gold-like “due/needs doing” task) → \"Responsibility Uncertainty\"\n   Extract minimal “needs changed/needs to be done/due for …” task clauses, e.g.:\n   - \"The cannular looks like it needs changed it has been in for 3 days.\"\n   - \"He’s due for MRSA and VRE surveillance swabs\"\n   - \": Not yet we still need to do them\"\n   IMPORTANT: Do NOT overuse this label for meds that are simply “due now” unless it matches the established gold-like task templates. (In prior feedback, \"is due for analgesia now\" was not gold.)\n\n7) “For surgery” fragment → \"Source Uncertainty\"\n   Extract ONLY: \"She’s for surgery\" / \"He’s for surgery\" (do not expand).\n\n8) Provenance-limited hedge like “to me” → \"Hedge / Probability Language\"\n   Extract compact clauses like: \"no new allergies disclosed to me\"\n\nWHAT TO AVOID (common false positives)\n- Do NOT extract general plan uncertainty or workflow uncertainty:\n  \"doctors haven’t reviewed yet\", \"not sure of the plan\", “awaiting review” (unless it matches one of the specific gold templates above).\n- Do NOT mark routine scheduled times as indefinite unless explicitly uncertain (e.g., “no exact time yet”, “sometime”).\n- Avoid generic conditionals (“if you need it”, “once I’ve checked”, “follow up”, etc.).\n- Avoid subjective nursing status phrases unless they match the stable/monitoring templates above.\n\nSPAN BOUNDARY RULES (critical; optimize IoU)\n- Exact substring only; no normalization.\n- Keep spans minimal BUT aligned to gold-favored clause boundaries:\n  - Include punctuation that is part of the clause (comma/period) when present in text and likely part of gold (e.g., \"Observations are stable.\", \"vitals stable,\").\n  - If a leading \":\" is present immediately before the clause in the transcript, include it (e.g., \": He remains under close monitoring\").\n- Avoid overlapping/duplicate spans from the same sentence; choose the single most gold-like clause.\n\nFINAL CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT\n- Validate each label is exactly from the label set.\n- Validate each quote appears verbatim in text.\n- Output ONLY: {\"pred_spans\": [...]} is NOT allowed. Output ONLY the JSON list named pred_spans (i.e., the raw list itself).",
