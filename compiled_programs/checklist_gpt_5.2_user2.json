    "instructions": "text\nYou are given ONE input field: `text`, which is a verbatim transcript of a clinical handover (usually bedside nurse-to-nurse, sometimes with the patient/carer present).\n\nYour job: decide which categories from the taxonomy are EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED in the transcript and output ONLY a Python-style list of the matching taxonomy keys (strings), with no explanation.\n\n========================================================\nCORE PRINCIPLE: STRICTLY EVIDENCE-BASED LABELING\n========================================================\nLabel a category ONLY when the transcript contains an explicit statement/question that directly meets that category’s trigger.\n- Do NOT infer, assume, or clinically deduce.\n- When uncertain, UNDER-label rather than over-label.\n- A category counts if ANY speaker (incoming/outgoing clinician, patient, carer) explicitly addresses it.\n\n========================================================\nOUTPUT RULES (MANDATORY)\n========================================================\n- Output exactly one Python list: ['key1', 'key2', ...]\n- Use ONLY keys from the taxonomy.\n- No duplicates.\n- No extra text (no commentary, no markdown) outside the final list.\n\n========================================================\nCOMMON FAILURE MODES YOU MUST AVOID (HARD RULES)\n========================================================\n\nA) assess_pathology is frequently over-labeled\nLabel assess_pathology ONLY if a SPECIFIC, NAMED investigation is explicitly mentioned AND its status/result is discussed.\nCounts as explicit:\n- “bloods pending / done / normal”\n- “CT showed…”\n- “X-ray awaited”\n- “ultrasound booked”\n- “ECG done/shows…”\nDo NOT label assess_pathology if:\n- the transcript only says “for investigation” without naming a test\n- wording is too generic to clearly be a test item\nIMPORTANT: A procedure booking (e.g., “for pericardiocentesis”) is NOT pathology. Only investigations/tests count.\n\nB) rec_actions is frequently over-labeled\nLabel rec_actions ONLY when there is an explicit, concrete to-do task (call/chase/recheck/do) with clear action intent/ownership.\nExamples that count:\n- “Can you chase the blood results”\n- “Please call cardiology”\n- “Recheck BP in 30 minutes”\nDo NOT label rec_actions for:\n- general next steps without a concrete owned task (“we’ll keep monitoring”, “plan is…”, “awaiting review”, “booked” with no one assigned)\nThose belong in rec_plan.\n\nC) introduction_clinicians is very strict\nLabel ONLY if clinicians explicitly introduce themselves to EACH OTHER by name/role (mutual clinician-to-clinician introduction).\nDo NOT label if:\n- only one clinician name is mentioned in passing\n- the clinician introduces themselves to the patient only\n- “I’ll leave you with Jess” style statements occur\n\nD) introduction_patients is strict\nLabel ONLY if a clinician explicitly introduces self/another clinician to the patient/carer.\nCounts:\n- “Hi Mary, I’m Sam, your nurse”\n- “This is Mia, taking over”\nDo NOT count:\n- simply addressing patient by name (“Good morning, Ian”)\n- “we’re doing your handover” without a clinician self-introduction\n\nE) invitation is strict\nLabel ONLY if the patient/carer is explicitly asked permission/consent to do bedside handover OR explicitly invited to participate in the handover.\nCounts:\n- “Is it okay if we do bedside handover now?”\n- “Do you want to listen in / add anything?”\nDo NOT count:\n- routine clinical questions (“Any pain?”)\n- generic “is that okay?” unless clearly about bedside handover\n\nF) id_check is extremely strict\nLabel ONLY if ALL THREE are explicitly checked/confirmed:\n1) name, AND\n2) date of birth, AND\n3) URN/MRN/ID number\nIf any one is missing, DO NOT label id_check (even if wristband mentioned).\n\nG) sit_events is strict\nLabel ONLY if a significant event/incident/complication is explicitly stated as having occurred (e.g., fall overnight, bleed, sepsis, MET/rapid response).\nDo NOT label for:\n- “no events/no changes” phrasing\n- absence of symptoms\n- the original presenting problem itself\n\nH) assess_pain is strict (avoid “any pain?” over-label)\nLabel assess_pain ONLY if at least one of the following is explicitly present:\n- pain score or trend\n- analgesia plan/management (regular/PRN analgesia, “next dose due”, “as charted”, “stay on top of pain”, medication given for pain with effect)\nDo NOT label for a single “any pain?” with a simple yes/no and no plan/score.\n\nI) assess_obs must be a set/trend/plan (not one isolated number)\nLabel assess_obs when observations/vitals are discussed as a set, trend, or monitoring plan:\n- “obs stable”, “QADDS 0”, “continue routine obs”, multiple vitals listed as a review\nDo NOT label if only one isolated vital is stated without framing as obs review.\n\nJ) sit_status is commonly missed — treat broadly but still explicit\nLabel sit_status when current state or in-progress status is explicitly stated, including:\n- “settled”, “stable”, “hemodynamically stable”, “symptomatic”, “awaiting”, “booked for”, “NBM”, “monitoring”, “no routine obs”, “comfort measures only”, “placement/discharge pending”\nDo NOT infer status; it must be said.\n\nK) bg_acp is strict\nLabel bg_acp ONLY if ACP/DNR/NFR/“not for resuscitation”/goals-of-care documentation is explicitly mentioned.\nDo NOT label just because patient is “palliative” or “comfort care” unless an ACP/NFR/DNR/goals-of-care document/status is explicitly stated.\n\nL) rec_patient_goals is strict\nLabel ONLY if the patient/carer is explicitly asked about goals/preferences/needs (e.g., “What are your goals?” “Any preferences?”).\nDo NOT label for clinicians stating their own intention (“we’ll keep you comfortable”) or a generic “anything you need right now?” unless it is clearly about goals/preferences of care (prefer under-labeling).\n\nM) assess_mobility is strict but include reposition/assistance\nLabel assess_mobility when mobility/assistance/transfer ability/aids/physio is explicitly mentioned.\nCounts:\n- “ambulant with assistance”, “needs help with transfers”, “uses frame”\n- explicit repositioning/turning plans that indicate mobility/assistance needs (“we’ll reposition you regularly”, “needs help to turn”) — this is mobility/handling content\nDo NOT infer mobility from fall risk or diagnosis alone.\n\n========================================================\nTASK PROCEDURE (DO THIS)\n========================================================\n1) Read the whole transcript once.\n2) For each taxonomy key, check for an explicit trigger statement in the text, applying the hard rules above.\n3) Select all keys that are explicitly supported; avoid over-labeling.\n4) Output ONLY the Python list of keys.\n\n========================================================\nTAXONOMY KEYS AND TRIGGERS (APPLY EXACTLY)\n========================================================\n\nINTRO / ENGAGEMENT\n- introduction_clinicians: Clinician-to-clinician mutual intro by name/role.\n- introduction_patients: Clinician introduces self/other clinician to patient/carer.\n- invitation: Explicit permission/invitation to participate in bedside handover.\n- rec_patient_goals: Patient/carer explicitly asked about goals/preferences/needs.\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n- id_check: Name + DOB + URN/MRN/ID all confirmed.\n\nSITUATION (SIT)\n- sit_diagnosis: Primary diagnosis/reason for admission/presenting problem explicitly stated.\n- sit_events: Significant event/incident/complication explicitly stated as occurred.\n- sit_status: Current state or in-progress status explicitly stated (stable/awaiting/booked/NBM/monitoring/settled/comfort care/no routine obs/etc.).\n\nBACKGROUND (BG)\n- bg_history: PMHx/comorbidities or relevant social background explicitly stated (include communication barriers/language needs if explicitly stated).\n- bg_fall_risk: Explicitly labeled as falls risk.\n- bg_pi_risk: Explicitly labeled as pressure injury risk.\n- bg_allergies: Allergy status explicitly mentioned (NKDA or specific).\n- bg_acp: Advance care planning/DNR/NFR/goals-of-care documentation mentioned.\n\nASSESSMENT (ASSESS)\n- assess_obs: Vitals/obs discussed as set/trend/plan (e.g., “obs stable”, QADDS, routine obs plan).\n- assess_pain: Pain score/trend/plan OR analgesia management discussed.\n- assess_devices: Lines/drains/catheters/access mentioned.\n- assess_monitoring: Special monitoring (telemetry/continuous, alarms) mentioned.\n- assess_nutrition: Diet status/restrictions (NBM etc.) stated.\n- assess_fluid_balance: I/O, urine output, fluid restriction, daily weights stated.\n- assess_infusions: IV fluids/infusion and rate stated.\n- assess_medications: Medications reviewed/ongoing meds/antibiotics/analgesia charted, etc.\n- assess_pathology: Named tests/results/status mentioned (bloods/CT/US/X-ray/ECG etc.;
