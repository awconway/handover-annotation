When in doubt, do NOT label the category.\n\n--------------------\n1. INTRODUCTIONS\n--------------------\n\n1.1 introduction_clinicians\n- Mark this ONLY if:\n  - Every clinician who participates in the handover (e.g., both the incoming and outgoing nurse, plus any others) is individually introduced by name and/or role, AND\n  - The introduction is directed clearly to the patient/carer.\n- Qualifying example:\n  - \"Good morning, Nina. I’m Hannah, the nurse who’ll be looking after you today. This is Sam, the night nurse who’s been caring for you.\"\n- Do NOT mark if:\n  - Only one clinician introduces themselves.\n  - The other clinician is mentioned but does not personally introduce themselves (e.g., \"This is the nurse taking over for the day\" without that nurse saying \"I’m X\").\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 2: Incoming nurse says, \"I’m Jack\"; outgoing nurse never self-introduces → do NOT label `introduction_clinicians`.\n  - Example 3: Outgoing nurse says \"This is Sam, the day nurse...\" and incoming nurse then says \"Hi Bill, I’m Sam.\" Even though both are effectively named, the feedback still did NOT label `introduction_clinicians`. Follow that conservative standard: only label when it is very clear that *all* clinicians who participate have explicitly introduced themselves, and dataset feedback for similar patterns confirms it.\n\n1.2 introduction_patients\n- Mark when the clinicians **identify the patient** to each other, in the patient’s presence, e.g.:\n  - \"This is bed 3, Mr. Kyle Jensen, 29 years old...\"\n  - \"I’m handing over Mr. Alan Roberts, 76 years old.\"\n- Typical forms:\n  - Bed + name: \"Bed three, Bill Jefferies, 63 years old, under Dr Lane.\"\n  - Admission intro: \"This is Mr. Rakesh Patel in Bed 1, Room 3, aged 58, under Dr. Morrison.\"\n- Does NOT require a full ID check.\n- Do NOT mark just because the conversation starts with the patient’s name without an explicit \"handover/introduction\" context.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: \"Hi, I’m handing over Mr. David Lang in bed 11.\" was NOT labelled `introduction_patients` by feedback. Therefore, be stricter:\n    - Only label `introduction_patients` when the wording clearly functions as a formal identification of the patient (e.g. \"This is Mr. X in bed Y...\" or similar), and dataset feedback for similar formulations supports this.\n\n1.3 invitation\n- Requires an **explicit invitation** to participate in or consent to handover.\n- Mark when:\n  - Asking consent to do bedside handover:\n    - \"We’ll do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that’s okay.\"\n  - Or clearly inviting participation:\n    - \"Please jump in if we miss anything.\"\n- Do NOT mark for:\n  - Generic care questions (\"Any pain?\" \"Anything you need right now?\") unless they are clearly tied to participation in handover.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 2: \"We’ll do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that’s okay.\" WAS considered `invitation`.\n  - Example 3: \"We’ll do a quick bedside handover. Please jump in if we miss anything.\" WAS considered `invitation`.\n- Follow this: explicit mention of \"bedside handover\" + \"if that’s okay\" OR statement like \"please jump in if we miss anything\" count as `invitation`.\n\n--------------------\n2. IDENTIFICATION\n--------------------\n\n2.1 id_check\n- Stricter than `introduction_patients`.\n- Requires checking **three identifiers**:\n  - Name\n  - Date of birth\n  - ID number (URN, MRN, etc.) or a clearly described 3‑identifier band/record check.\n- There must be:\n  - Patient confirmation, OR\n  - Verification against an ID band/record implying all three.\n- Mark ONLY if it is crystal clear that all three identifiers are checked.\n- Do NOT mark if:\n  - Only the name is confirmed.\n  - Only name and age or name and DOB appear.\n  - There is a generic \"ID band checks out\" without detail.\n\n--------------------\n3. SITUATION (CURRENT ADMISSION & REASON)\n--------------------\n\n3.1 sit_diagnosis\n- Primary diagnosis or reason for admission.\n- Examples:\n  - \"Admitted yesterday following a left-sided ischemic stroke.\"\n  - \"Admitted this morning for an elective inguinal hernia repair.\"\n  - \"Admitted today with known cancer and a recent brain injury.\"\n- Mark when:\n  - Presenting problem, working diagnosis, or main admission reason is stated.\n\n3.2 sit_events\n- Significant clinical events or complications since admission:\n  - Deteriorations, seizures, falls, ICU transfers, new neurology, code blues, etc., clearly described as separate events.\n- Do NOT mark if:\n  - Only the initial diagnosis is provided with no separate \"event\" described.\n\n3.3 sit_status\n- Current clinical or management trajectory:\n  - Statements like \"he’s currently stable,\" \"hemodynamically stable,\" \"remains under close monitoring.\"\n  - Awaiting tests, procedures, or reviews: \"awaiting theatre,\" \"for repeat bloods tomorrow,\" \"echocardiogram still needs to be arranged.\"\n  - Ongoing management summarised as current status: \"hourly obs for another four hours, then four‑hourly,\" \"wound care is ongoing.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: \"He’s currently stable\" + Q-ADDS detail → `sit_status`.\n  - Example 2: \"He’s hemodynamically stable\" + \"awaiting theatre\" → `sit_status`.\n  - Example 3: \"He remains under close monitoring\" and ongoing observation schedule → `sit_status`.\n\n--------------------\n4. BACKGROUND\n--------------------\n\n4.1 bg_history\n- Relevant clinical or social history beyond the immediate presenting problem.\n- Examples:\n  - Chronic conditions: \"known cancer,\" \"hypertension.\"\n  - Social context: lives alone, in facility, etc., if mentioned.\n  - Other diagnoses or conditions: \"has had mild discomfort over the past few weeks,\" \"no previous surgeries\" (surgical history).\n- From feedback:\n  - \"No previous surgeries\" → `bg_history`.\n  - A comorbidity like “known cancer” in a brain injury admission → `bg_history`.\n\n4.2 bg_fall_risk\n- Explicit mention of falls risk or falls precautions:\n  - \"High falls risk,\" \"on falls precautions,\" \"needs supervision due to falls risk.\"\n- Do NOT infer from age or limited mobility alone.\n\n4.3 bg_pi_risk\n- Explicit mention of pressure injury risk or pressure area prevention:\n  - \"He’s high risk due to immobility. He’s on a pressure-relieving mattress, and we’re doing 2-hourly repositioning.\"\n  - \"Pressure area care chart is up to date.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: High risk due to immobility + pressure-relieving mattress + 2-hourly repositioning → `bg_pi_risk`.\n\n4.4 bg_allergies\n- Any explicit allergy information:\n  - \"No allergies.\"\n  - \"Allergic to penicillin.\"\n  - \"No known drug allergies.\"\n- Mark if allergies or explicit absence of allergies is stated.\n\n4.5 bg_acp\n- Advanced care planning (ACP), goals-of-care, resuscitation status:\n  - \"Not for resuscitation,\" \"has an ACP document,\" \"comfort care only.\"\n\n--------------------\n5. ASSESSMENT / CURRENT CARE DETAILS\n--------------------\n\n5.1 assess_obs\n- Vital signs or observation data, including:\n  - Numerical vitals: BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO₂, GCS, etc.\n  - Observations-based scores: Q-ADDS, MEWS, etc.\n  - General statements: \"observations have been stable,\" \"vitals within normal limits.\"\n  - Observation schedules: \"hourly obs for another four hours, then four‑hourly after that.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: Q-ADDS score and vitals → `assess_obs`.\n  - Example 2: \"Vitals are within normal limits\" → `assess_obs`.\n  - Example 3: \"hourly obs\" and continuation of neuro and vital sign observations → `assess_obs`.\n\n5.2 assess_pain\n- Any reference to pain or its management:\n  - \"No pain reported currently.\"\n  - \"Main issue is pain — he’s currently complaining of pain and is due for analgesia now.\"\n  - Description of discomfort: \"mild discomfort over the past few weeks.\"\n  - Analgesia given or planned *for pain*.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: Includes PRN Paracetamol; feedback says this counts → `assess_pain`.\n  - Example 2: Explicit \"No pain reported currently\" and follow‑up pain questions. Despite this, feedback for Example 2 did NOT count `assess_pain`. However, other examples and the global rules say: mention of pain presence/absence or pain meds → `assess_pain`.\n  - Example 3: Overt discussion of pain and analgesia, plus \"I’ll bring something for that right away\" → `assess_pain`.\n- Reconcile feedback:\n  - Use the global rule: any explicit mention of pain symptoms or analgesia/pain relief → `assess_pain`.\n  - The Example 2 feedback appears to be an exception; follow the *general* rule: explicit \"no pain\" or \"pain\" plus analgesia references → label `assess_pain`.\n\n5.3 assess_devices\n- Presence or explicit absence of devices/lines:\n  - IV cannulae: \"20G cannula in his left forearm — patent.\"\n  - Catheters: \"No IDC,\" \"indwelling catheter in situ.\"\n  - Drains, chest tubes, etc.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: \"20G cannula in his left forearm — patent, no IV fluids running\" → `assess_devices`.\n\n5.4 assess_monitoring\n- Continuous or special monitoring (beyond routine intermittent obs):\n  - \"On telemetry,\" \"continuous cardiac monitoring,\" \"continuous pulse oximetry.\"\n- Do NOT mark for normal obs schedules (those are `assess_obs`).\n\n5.5 assess_nutrition\n- Diet or nutritional status:\n  - \"Nil by mouth\" (NBM).\n  - \"He’s now allowed to eat and drink.\"\n  - \"On a full/general diet,\" \"on thickened fluids,\" etc.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 2: \"He’s nil by mouth and awaiting theatre\" → `assess_nutrition`.\n  - Example 3: \"He’s now allowed to eat and drink\" and discussion of lunch/fluids → `assess_nutrition`.\n\n5.6 assess_fluid_balance\n- Fluid intake, output, or formal restriction:\n  - \"Fluid balance chart: input 1200 mL, output 900 mL.\"\n  - \"On 1.5L fluid restriction.\"\n  - Any explicit statement about intake/output totals or fluid restriction.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 2: `assess_fluid_balance` was expected even though not explicitly spelled out in the snippet. Treat:\n    - NBM alone is *not* `assess_fluid_balance` (that is nutrition).\n    - However, explicit fluid statements (e.g., \"fluids at 125 mL/hr,\" \"oral fluids encouraged\") can overlap with `assess_fluid_balance` where they clearly relate to intake.\n  - Example 3: \"He’s on ongoing IV fluids at 125 mL/hour\" → counts for fluid balance (intake) as well as `assess_infusions`.\n\n5.7 assess_infusions\n- Ongoing or planned **continuous infusions**:\n  - \"IV fluids at 125 mL/hour running.\"\n  - \"Insulin infusion,\" \"inotropes infusion,\" \"sedation infusion.\"\n- Distinguish from:\n  - `assess_devices`: the presence of the IV cannula.\n  - `assess_medications`: listing of medications, including IV bolus or intermittent antibiotics.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: Nurse says \"no IV fluids running\" → there is an infusion *status* being discussed (absence). Feedback says this SHOULD be labelled `assess_infusions`.\n  - Example 3: \"He’s on ongoing IV fluids at 125 mL/hour\" → `assess_infusions`.\n\n5.8 assess_medications\n- Medication regimen, specific named meds, or classes:\n  - \"Aspirin 100 mg daily, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Perindopril 4 mg daily, Paracetamol 1 g QID PRN.\"\n  - \"Medications include atorvastatin 20mg daily and paracetamol PRN. No anticoagulants.\"\n  - Oral or IV antibiotics, regular and PRN meds, etc.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1 and 2 and 3: Listing of meds always → `assess_medications`.\n\n5.9 assess_pathology\n- Pathology/lab tests or results (not imaging):\n  - \"Pre-op bloods...have been completed.\"\n  - \"He’s for repeat bloods tomorrow.\"\n  - \"LFTs and FBC are normal.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 2: \"Pre-op bloods...have been completed\" → `assess_pathology`.\n- Do NOT mark for:\n  - Imaging only (CT, MRI, x-ray, ultrasound) unless bloods/labs are explicitly mentioned.\n\n5.10 assess_mobility\n- Mobility and assistance, ADLs:\n  - \"Requires full assistance with mobility and personal care.\"\n  - \"Mobilising with assistance.\"\n  - \"Independent with cares.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: \"requires full assistance with mobility and personal care\" → `assess_mobility`.\n\n5.11 assess_skin_integrity\n- Wounds, dressings, ulcers, pressure areas, and their care:\n  - \"No current pressure injuries.\"\n  - \"Dressing is clean, dry, and intact.\"\n  - \"Stage 2 pressure injury on his right shoulder.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: \"No current pressure injuries\" and ongoing skin checks → `assess_skin_integrity`.\n  - Example 3: \"No bleeding noted from the head; dressing is clean, dry, and intact.\" → `assess_skin_integrity`.\n\n--------------------\n6. RECOMMENDATIONS / PLAN\n--------------------\n\n6.1 rec_discharge_plan\n- Explicit discharge planning:\n  - \"Plan is to discharge tomorrow if stable.\"\n  - \"If CT is negative, he can go home today.\"\n- Must include either timing or criteria for going home or to another facility.\n\n6.2 rec_actions\n- **Urgent or time‑critical** clinician-directed tasks or escalation instructions:\n  - \"Call the doctor immediately if his obs deteriorate.\"\n  - \"Needs urgent cardiology review now.\"\n  - \"Escalate to medical team if no CT result in one hour.\"\n- Do NOT mark for:\n  - Generic patient instructions, even if urgent in nature, unless dataset clearly shows they are treated as clinician plan items.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example where \"If you feel any chest pain...press your call bell straight away\" was NOT labelled `rec_actions`. Follow this: patient advice alone does not count; label `rec_actions` mainly for clinician‑to‑clinician, time‑critical plans.\n\n6.3 rec_plan\n- Ongoing or routine plan for care:\n  - \"I’ll continue pressure care, hygiene support, and monitor his Q-ADDS.\"\n  - \"Plan is to keep monitoring for now.\"\n  - \"I’ll follow up with the surgical team and theatre staff.\"\n  - \"Continue hourly obs for four hours then four‑hourly.\"\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 1: \"I’ll continue pressure care, hygiene support, and monitor his Q-ADDS\" → `rec_plan`.\n  - Example 2: \"I’ll follow up with the surgical team and theatre staff... I’ll be back shortly to check your observations and review your chart\" → `rec_plan`.\n  - Example 3: Clear summary: continue obs schedule, give analgesia, maintain IV fluids → `rec_plan`.\n\n6.4 rec_patient_goals\n- Patient/carer goals, wishes, or preferences explicitly elicited and incorporated into the plan:\n  - Asking about needs in a way that informs ongoing care and responding to them.\n  - Example: \"Are you feeling up to some lunch and a sip of water?\" followed by adapting actions accordingly.\n- From feedback:\n  - Example 3: The nurse asks Bill if he feels up to eating and then tailors the plan (pain relief then food and fluids). This was labelled `rec_patient_goals`.\n- Be conservative:\n  - Do NOT mark for a generic comfort question like \"Anything you need before we finish handover?\" unless the context shows it shapes the subsequent plan.\n  - In Example 2, \"Is there anything you need before we finish handover?\" was *not* labelled `rec_patient_goals`. Follow that precedent.\n\n====================\n7. GENERAL DECISION STRATEGY\n====================\n\n1. Read the entire transcript carefully.\n2. For each category, ask:\n   - Is there explicit evidence that this content was addressed?\n   - Does the phrasing match a feedback-supported pattern?\n3. Only assign a category if:\n   - It is directly mentioned, OR\n   - The dataset feedback examples treat analogous wording as that category.\n4. Do NOT:\n   - Infer categories from what is typical in clinical practice.\n   - Assume risk factors (falls, pressure injuries, allergies, ACP) without explicit mention.\n   - Overshoot on introductions: be strict with `introduction_clinicians` and `introduction_patients`.\n   - Overuse `rec_actions`: reserve for clinician-directed, time‑critical plans.\n5. Multiple categories can be present simultaneously.\n6. Think carefully about borderline cases:\n   - NBM → `assess_nutrition` (not fluid balance by itself).\n   - Running IV fluids at a rate → `assess_infusions` AND usually `assess_fluid_balance`.\n   - Listing medications → `assess_medications`; if explicitly for pain, also `assess_pain`.\n\n====================\n8. EXAMPLE-BASED CLARIFICATIONS\n====================\n\nUse these feedback-derived examples to calibrate:\n\n- Example 1 (stroke patient with Q-ADDS, pressure care, no IV fluids running):\n  - Correct labels:  \n    `[\"sit_diagnosis\", \"sit_status\", \"bg_pi_risk\", \"assess_obs\", \"assess_devices\", \"assess_mobility\", \"assess_skin_integrity\", \"assess_medications\", \"assess_infusions\", \"assess_pain\", \"rec_plan\"]`\n  - Not labelled: `introduction_patients`.\n\n- Example 2 (Mr. Patel, elective hernia repair, nil by mouth, pre-op workup done):\n  - Correct labels:  \n    `[\"introduction_patients\", \"invitation\", \"sit_diagnosis\", \"sit_status\", \"bg_history\", \"bg_allergies\", \"assess_obs\", \"assess_fluid_balance\", \"assess_nutrition\", \"assess_pathology\", \"assess_medications\", \"rec_plan\"]`\n  - Not labelled: `introduction_clinicians`, `assess_pain`, `rec_patient_goals`.\n\n- Example 3 (Bill with cancer and brain injury, pain issues, IV fluids running, dressing intact):\n  - Correct labels:  \n    `[\"introduction_patients\", \"invitation\", \"sit_diagnosis\", \"sit_status\", \"assess_obs\", \"assess_pain\", \"assess_devices\", \"assess_nutrition\", \"assess_fluid_balance\", \"assess_infusions\", \"assess_medications\", \"assess_skin_integrity\", \"rec_plan\", \"rec_patient_goals\"]`\n  - Not labelled: `introduction_clinicians`.\n\nYour final answer for any new transcript must be ONLY a JSON-style list of category keys, e.g.:\n\n[\"sit_diagnosis\", \"assess_obs\", \"rec_plan\"]",
