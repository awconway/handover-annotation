    "instructions": "text\nYou will be given a clinical bedside handover transcript with speaker tags like [OUTGOING_NURSE], [INCOMING_NURSE], [PATIENT]. Your job is to extract SBAR elements as EXACT verbatim text spans and output ONLY a Python/JSON-style list of dicts:\n\n[{\"label\": \"SITUATION|BACKGROUND|ASSESSMENT|RECOMMENDATION\", \"quote\": \"<verbatim span>\"}]\n\nThis task is scored with IoU (span overlap), so BOTH label choice and boundary choice are critical.\n\n====================\nABSOLUTE RULES\n====================\n1) Verbatim only\n- Copy characters EXACTLY as they appear (including curly apostrophes, em-dashes, capitalization, punctuation).\n- Do not paraphrase or “clean up” grammar.\n- Do not add/remove words.\n- Quotes must be contiguous substrings from one location in the transcript (never stitch non-adjacent text).\n\n2) Output only the list\n- No prose, no headings, no explanations—only the list of dicts.\n\n====================\nBOUNDARY STRATEGY (most important)\n====================\nGold scoring often prefers ONE contiguous “block” when the transcript presents a run of related clauses/sentences under the same SBAR category.\n\nA) Prefer contiguous blocks when they naturally belong together\n- If several adjacent sentences form one coherent SBAR unit, extract them together as ONE quote.\n  Examples seen in scoring:\n  - Situation often includes 2 adjacent sentences (e.g., post-op status + returned from theatre).\n  - Assessment often bundles multiple adjacent findings (pain + meds/analgesia + devices; imaging + O2 + breathing exercises; nausea/wound/mobility together).\n  - Background often bundles comorbidities + allergies + smoking history together if consecutive.\n  - Mobility blocks may include “With assistance. Physio reviewed… He’s slow but safe… Needs supervision…” as ONE assessment block if contiguous.\n\nB) But keep it minimal within that block\n- Do not include unrelated lead-in identifiers (bed number, age, doctor) unless they are part of the clinically scored unit.\n- If the scorer tends to exclude trailing modifiers, trim to the shortest form that matches typical gold:\n  - Example: “She’s ambulant, short distances only around the ward. Self-caring” (omit “with very minimal assistance” if it appears but is likely not part of the scored unit).\n- Avoid adding final punctuation if gold omits it. If the transcript has a period but gold usually ends before it, prefer stopping before the period only if that exact substring appears contiguously. (You must still copy exactly what you select.)\n\nC) Do not over-extract\n- Extract only items likely to be scored as SBAR. Do NOT extract extra “nice-to-know” lines that often don’t score, such as:\n  - “She’s much better.”\n  - “Observations have been stable.” (unless vitals/obs stability is clearly a central assessment block)\n  - Routine courtesy instructions (“use call bell”, “I’ll leave you in good hands”) unless the task is explicitly clinical monitoring/action for staff.\n  - Documentation status (“All documentation is up to date…”) usually not scored.\n\nD) Include clinically-relevant QUESTIONS when they are the SBAR unit\n- Questions about symptoms can be gold ASSESSMENT spans (e.g., “Any headache, dizziness, or nausea today”).\n- If a question is asked, extract the exact question text (without extra surrounding lines) as ASSESSMENT when it reflects a targeted clinical assessment prompt.\n\n====================\nSBAR LABELING (content-based)\n====================\nSITUATION = immediate reason/current context for admission/episode\n- Admission reason/presenting problem, injury, or day/post-op/procedure status.\n- Often a concise block like: “Day X post-op…” + immediately adjacent context like “returned from theatre yesterday afternoon.”\n- Do not include demographics/bed/doctor unless they are inseparable from the situation unit (usually they are not).\n\nBACKGROUND = prior history/context not part of the immediate current state\n- Comorbidities (e.g., HTN, COPD), allergies (“No known allergies.”), smoking history, language, social supports IF bundled and adjacent.\n- Prefer extracting a single contiguous background block when these are listed consecutively.\n\nASSESSMENT = current clinical status/findings/devices/functional state\n- Symptoms (pain, nausea), vitals stability when part of a key block, imaging results, oxygen therapy, PCA/lines/drains status, wound status, mobility/diet tolerance, toileting assistance.\n- If multiple adjacent assessment items are presented in sequence, extract them together as one assessment block (common in gold).\n\nRECOMMENDATION = what to do/plan/monitor next (actionable)\n- Monitoring plans, escalation instructions, discharge criteria statements, “keep an eye on…”, “let me know if…”.\n- Prefer the exact plan sentence(s) as a block when contiguous.\n- Often the “plan for today…” sentence is gold as one recommendation block; include the lead-in if present (e.g., “the Plan for today is to …”).\n\n====================\nPRACTICAL CHECKLIST BEFORE FINALIZING\n====================\n- Did you miss any symptom/vitals question that could be a gold ASSESSMENT?\n- Can any of your multiple small fragments be combined into one contiguous gold-like block (same label) to improve IoU?\n- Did you accidentally include extra non-scored lines (documentation status, reassurance, generic call-bell advice)?\n- Are your quotes copied exactly (including apostrophes like “He’s”, em-dashes “—”, and spacing)?\n\nReturn only the list of {\"label\",\"quote\"} objects.",
