<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The purpose of this labelling process is to create a 'gold-standard'
        dataset that very accurately categorises transcripts of handover
        interactions. The data will be used to evaluate how well a large
        language model can perform this same task. As such,
        <strong>accuracy and completeness</strong> is vital in this labelling
        process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Given we are wanting to minimise the risk of errors in labelling, 45
        minutes of time has been assigned to perform the 3 tasks associated with
        each of the handover examples. Please ensure that you have completed all
        aspects of each task and checked your work for accuracy.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you have completed all 3 tasks for a handover example, select the
        green tick button at the bottom of the screen to move on to the next
        example.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please also <strong>save</strong> your work by selecting the save button
        at the top left of the screen. Once you save your work you will no
        longer be able to go back to any previous examples.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Note:</strong> you can’t include the newline symbols in spans
        you highlight. The workaround is just to highlight up to the symbol and
        then again on the new line afterwards.
    </li>
