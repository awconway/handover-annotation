    The task is to extract quotes from the text of a clinical handover transcript that aligns with the SBAR framework (SITUATION, BACKGROUND, ASSESSMENT, RECOMMENDATION) and label them accordingly.

    Instructions
    - If the transcript contains multiple different pieces of information within the same SBAR category from different sections of the text, extract each as a separate quote.
    - **Do not combine parts from different sections of the text into a single quote.**
    - Extracted quotes must appear **exactly as written in the original transcript**, preserving spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and phrasing. Do not paraphrase. Do not summarize. Do not correct incorrectly spelled words. Do not correct errors. Do not rephrase.
    - Assign quotes to the correct SBAR label based on its content, regardless of its position in the transcript.
    - If parts of the text do not fit into any SBAR category, do not extract it.
    - Quotes should only be assigned to one of the SBAR labels.
