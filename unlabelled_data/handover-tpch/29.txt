[Incoming Nurse]: Thanks. What’s the current status of the wound?
[Outgoing Nurse]: It’s a shallow ulcer with partial thickness skin loss. No slough or necrosis, but the area is red and moist. No signs of infection at this stage. The wound was last dressed yesterday with Mepilex Border, and it’s due for review and redressing this morning.
