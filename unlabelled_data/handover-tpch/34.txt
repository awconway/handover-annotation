[Outgoing Nurse]: Hi, I’m handing over Mr. David Lang in bed 11. He’s a 71-year-old patient admitted yesterday following a left-sided ischemic stroke. He’s currently stable but has significant right-sided weakness and requires full assistance with mobility and personal care.
[Incoming Nurse]: Thanks. What’s his current Q-ADDS score?
[Outgoing Nurse]: His Q-ADDS score is 2—based on his BP and reduced mobility.
Latest obs are BP: 142/86, HR: 78 bpm, RR: 16, Temp: 36.7°C, SpO?: 96% on room air, GCS: of 15
[Incoming Nurse]: Any pressure area concerns?
[Outgoing Nurse]: No current pressure injuries, but he’s high risk due to immobility. He’s on a pressure-relieving mattress and we’re doing 2-hourly repositioning. Skin checks are ongoing—no redness or breakdown noted.
[Incoming Nurse]: What about hygiene needs?
[Outgoing Nurse]: He requires full assistance with hygiene. He had a full wash this morning including peri-care. He’s continent of urine and bowels—opened bowels yesterday, formed stool. No IDC.
[Incoming Nurse]: Any IV access or medications?
[Outgoing Nurse]: Yes, he has a 20G cannula in his left forearm—patent, no IV fluids running.
Medications: Aspirin 100 mg daily, Atorvastatin 40 mg nocte, Perindopril 4 mg daily, Paracetamol 1g QID PRN
[Incoming Nurse]: Thanks. I’ll continue pressure care, hygiene support, and monitor his Q-ADDS.
