[WARD_NURSE]: Thanks. Can you give me a quick summary?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: Sure. He was admitted with acute urinary retention and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. He had some clinical deterioration pre-op—low BP, reduced urine output, and confusion—but he’s responded well to treatment. He’s now passing urine via IDC, and output is improving.

[WARD_NURSE]:
Any medications charted?

[WARD_NURSE]: Any communication needs?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: No, he’s English-speaking, fully alert and orientated. He’s a bit tired but understands what’s happening.
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: Hi Mr. Nguyen, this is your ward nurse, she’ll be looking after you now. You’re doing well after your procedure.
[PATIENT]: Thanks. I feel a bit groggy but better than before. Am I going back to my room now?
[WARD_NURSE]: Yes, we’ll get you settled in shortly. I’ll keep checking your blood pressure and make sure everything’s comfortable. If you need anything, just press the call bell.
[PATIENT]: Okay, thank you.
[RECOVERY_NURSE]:He’s due for post-op obs in 30 minutes, and the IDC needs to be monitored closely. Urology team will review later today.
