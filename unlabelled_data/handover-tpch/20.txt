[RECOVERY_NURSE]:
Hi, I’m handing over Mr. Thomas Nguyen, 74 years old, transferring to your ward post-procedure. He had a urethral dilation and bladder washout under general anaesthetic due to acute urinary retention and suspected obstructive uropathy.
[WARD_NURSE]: Thanks. How did the procedure go?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: It went smoothly. No complications in theatre. He’s now stable but needs close monitoring due to recent deterioration pre-op—he was hypotensive and oliguric. He’s now passing urine via IDC, and output is improving.
[WARD_NURSE]: Vitals?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: BP: 112/70, HR: 88 bpm, RR: 18, SpO?: 97% on room air, Temp: 37.4°C, Urine output: 120 mL in the last hour
[WARD_NURSE]: Any lines or attachments?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: Yes: he has an IDC draining with clear urine, an IV cannula in left forearm, there are No infusions running currently and Oxygen via nasal prongs earlier, now weaned off
[WARD_NURSE]: Any medications charted?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: He’s on: Paracetamol 1g QID, Gentamicin IV stat dose given in theatre, PRN oxycodone and IV fluids were running intra-op, now ceased.
[WARD_NURSE]: Any communication needs?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: Yes, he’s from a Vietnamese-speaking background and has limited English. Interpreter has been requested for ward rounds. His son is bilingual and will be visiting later today.
[WARD_NURSE]: Thanks. Any outstanding tasks?
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: He’s due for post-op obs in 30 minutes, and the IDC needs to be monitored closely. Urology team will review later today. He’s alert but tired.
[WARD_NURSE]: Perfect. I’ll get him settled and continue monitoring.
[RECOVERY_NURSE]: Great. Let me know if anything changes. All documentation is up to date.
