[NURSE]: Hi Dr. Ahmed, I need you to urgently review Mr. Leonard Price in bed 10. He’s a 76-year-old patient with a history of congestive heart failure and COPD. He’s deteriorated over the last few hours with worsening shortness of breath and low oxygen saturations.

What’s happening currently?

Auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. He’s likely fluid overloaded—his legs are oedematous, and his fluid balance is +1800 mL over the last 48 hours.

[DOCTOR]: Any current respiratory support?
[NURSE]: Not yet, but I believe he needs to be started on BiPAP. I’ve prepped the machine and mask. He’s not tolerating high-flow oxygen and is tiring.
[DOCTOR]: IV access?
[NURSE]: Yes, he has a 22G cannula in his right forearm, patent. No current IV fluids running. He’s on a fluid restriction chart.

He’s charted for: Frusemide 40 mg IV BD – last dose was this morning, Spiriva inhaler daily, PRN salbutamol neb – given 1 hour ago, Paracetamol 1g QID PRN. He has No known allergies.
[DOCTOR]: Thanks. We’ll start BiPAP immediately and arrange for transfer to HDU or the respiratory unit. Please continue monitoring and notify me of any changes.
[NURSE]: Will do. I’ll document the escalation and prep for transfer.
