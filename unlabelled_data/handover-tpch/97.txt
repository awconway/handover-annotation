[NURSE]: Hi, I’m handing over Mr. Daniel Jordan, 31 years old. Daniel, this is Alicia, one of our pharmacists. She’s here to talk to you about your new medication.
[PHARMACIST]: Hi Daniel, nice to meet you. I understand you’ve just been diagnosed with epilepsy.
[PATIENT]: Yeah… it’s a bit of a shock. I had a seizure yesterday, and they said it was my first one.
[NURSE]: He had a generalised tonic-clonic seizure yesterday morning. CT and EEG are pending, but neurology has started him on levetiracetam 500 mg BD. No IV access now—he’s on oral meds only. No known allergies.
[PHARMACIST]: Thanks. Daniel, I’ll go through how to take your medication, what side effects to watch for, and how to manage your day-to-day safely. Have you had a chance to read the medication leaflet?
[PATIENT]: Not yet. I’m still trying to take it all in.
[PHARMACIST]: That’s okay—we’ll take it step by step. Levetiracetam is taken twice a day, about 12 hours apart. It’s important not to miss doses. Some people feel a bit tired or moody when they first start, but that usually settles. If you feel very low or notice any big changes in mood, let us know straight away.
[NURSE]: He’s also on a food and fluid chart while we monitor his intake—he’s been a bit nauseous since yesterday but is improving.
[PHARMACIST]: Good to know. Daniel, you’ll also need to avoid driving for now—by law, you need to be seizure-free for a certain period before you can drive again. We’ll give you written information about that too.
[PATIENT]: Okay. I didn’t realise that.
[PHARMACIST]: Totally understandable. I’ll leave you with a medication info sheet and come back later to check if you have any questions. We’ll also make sure your GP and community pharmacy are updated when you’re discharged.
[NURSE]: Thanks, Alicia. I’ll keep monitoring his neuro obs and ensure he’s tolerating the meds. Daniel, just press the call bell if you feel unwell or have any questions.
[PATIENT]: Thanks both. I appreciate it.
