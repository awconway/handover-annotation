[INCOMING_NURSE]: Good morning, Mr. Jackson. I’m Sarah, and I’ll be your nurse for today. We’ll do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that’s okay.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Hi, Mr. Jackson. This is the nurse taking over for the day. Could you please confirm your full name?
[PATIENT]: David Jackson.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thank you. This is Mr. David Jackson in Bed 4, Room 6, aged 64, under Dr. Patel, Orthopaedic Consultant.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Mr. Jackson was admitted two days ago following a left femoral neck fracture sustained at home. He’s awaiting ORIF surgery, which is scheduled for tomorrow morning. He had a fall in the bathroom overnight—he slipped while attempting to mobilise independently.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Post-fall assessment was completed. No new injuries noted. He was reviewed by the medical team and remains hemodynamically stable. Neurovascular status of the affected limb is unchanged. Observations have remained within normal limits.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Pain is being managed with regular paracetamol and PRN oxycodone. Pain score was 5/10 on movement this morning. He’s currently on bed rest and has been reminded to use the call bell before mobilising. A falls incident report has been completed.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Jackson, how are you feeling this morning? Any pain or dizziness?
[PATIENT]: Just sore in the hip, but no dizziness.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s tolerating oral intake and has no nausea. No signs of infection. Pre-op bloods and ECG have been completed. Consent for surgery is signed and documented. Physio will review post-op.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll follow up with the surgical team and ensure falls precautions are in place. Is there anything you need before we finish handover?
[PATIENT]: No, I’m okay. Thanks.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Please use the call bell if you need anything. I’ll leave you in good hands.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll be back shortly to check your observations and review your chart, Mr. Jackson.
