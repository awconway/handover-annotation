[INCOMING_NURSE]: Good morning, Ms. Evans. I’m Sarah, and I’ll be your nurse for today. We’ll do a quick bedside handover with my colleague, if that’s okay.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Hi, Ms. Evans. This is the nurse taking over for the day. Could you please confirm your full name?
[PATIENT]: Chloe Evans.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Thank you. This is Ms. Chloe Evans in Bed 2, Room 10, aged 24, under Dr. Langford, Psychiatry Consultant.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Ms. Evans was admitted via ED yesterday with concerns of severe restrictive eating behaviour, low BMI, and fatigue. She was brought in by her mother, who reported significant weight loss over the past 3 months and increasing social withdrawal.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s currently on fluid and nutritional monitoring and has been started on a re-feeding protocol under dietitian guidance. Bloods show mild electrolyte imbalance—low phosphate and potassium. ECG showed sinus bradycardia, which is being monitored.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s alert and cooperative but has expressed anxiety around food and body image. A social worker referral has been made to support family involvement and explore outpatient supports post-discharge.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Ms. Evans, how are you feeling this morning? Any dizziness or nausea?
[PATIENT]: Just a bit light-headed, but I’m okay.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s had sips of oral nutrition supplement this morning and tolerated it. No vomiting or diarrhoea. Vitals are stable but she remains on daily ECG and bloods. She’s aware of the care plan and has agreed to meet with the mental health team later today.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll follow up with the dietitian and social worker and check your bloods once they’re back. Is there anything you need before we finish handover?
[PATIENT]: No, thank you.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Please use the call bell if you need anything. I’ll leave you in good hands.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll be back shortly to check your observations and review your chart, Ms. Evans.
