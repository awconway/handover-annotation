I was going to ask if you’d like to send a discharge summary with a note to the GP to monitor INR every 2–3 days initially, and adjust dosing as needed. I’ll also include a warfarin education leaflet and a yellow book for tracking.\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, please include that in the discharge paperwork.

{"text": "[DOCTOR]: Hi, I’m handing over Mr. Amir Rahman, 63 years old, admitted yesterday with what looks like a large anterior MI — the ECG was fairly convincing. He’s currently in ICU. They started an intra‑aortic balloon pump yesterday evening, mainly as a bridge to CABG, which is tentatively booked for two days from now, but that might shift depending on his stability.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Thanks. Can you give me a quick overview?\n[DOCTOR]: Sure. He’s still a bit haemodynamically shaky post‑MI, with ongoing low cardiac output. The IABP went in this morning via the femoral artery — I believe the cardiology registrar did it. It’s set to 1:1 augmentation. So far, he seems to be responding — BP’s come up a bit, and lactates look like they’re trending down, though the last result isn’t in yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any other lines or support?\n[DOCTOR]: Right, he’s got an arterial line in the right radial for continuous BP monitoring, a central line in the right internal jugular, and an IDC in situ. I think he’s also still connected to telemetry, but I’ll need to double‑check if that’s linked to the central monitoring unit. He’s on low‑dose noradrenaline, sitting around 2 micrograms a minute, but that’s fluctuated a little. IV heparin is running for balloon pump patency — pharmacy flagged a possible review of APTT later today.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any communication needs?\n[DOCTOR]: Yes, he’s from a non‑English speaking background — Arabic’s his first language. He understands basic English, but it’s hit‑and‑miss for more complex instructions. Somebody requested an interpreter for the family conference, but I’m not sure if it’s been booked yet. His son’s bilingual and has been helping, though he might not be around later tonight.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any pain or sedation?\n[DOCTOR]: He’s alert and orientated. No sedation required at this stage. Pain’s reasonably controlled with paracetamol and occasional oxycodone — he said it’s “okay,” but sounded a bit unsure. He’s anxious — understandably — so maybe consider whether some short‑acting anxiolytic’s needed if he escalates later.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Any allergies or medications?\n[DOCTOR]: No known drug allergies as far as documented. Meds include aspirin 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg nocte, the IV heparin infusion, noradrenaline, and the PRNs — paracetamol and oxycodone. I’ll have to check if his beta blocker’s been restarted post‑MI; cardiology had mentioned it but I didn’t see an order yet.\n[ICU_NURSE]: Thanks. I’ll keep monitoring IABP function and haemodynamics closely.\n[DOCTOR]: Perfect. Let me know if there’s any change in rhythm, perfusion, or balloon timing.

So Mr Fraser is under the cardiothoracic surgeon covering this list - not sure who.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He was admitted yesterday for a planned aortic valve replacement due to severe aortic stenosis. He’s currently stable, nil by mouth, and awaiting theatre — I think the procedure’s still set for this afternoon, though final time hasn’t been confirmed yet. Pre‑op bloods and ECG were done and look okay from what I saw, but anaesthetics still need to recheck his potassium levels. Consent’s signed and documented.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s on his regular cardiac medications — they were reviewed by the anaesthetics registrar this morning, or possibly one of the fellows. No chest pain or shortness of breath that he’s mentioned overnight. Vitals all fine — around baseline. He’s aware of the procedure and quite anxious, understandably; I reassured him but might be worth chatting again before transfer.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Mr. Fraser, how are you feeling this morning? Any discomfort or anything worrying you?\n[PATIENT]: Just nervous, really. No pain.\n[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Of course. His wife’s planning to come in later today — she wasn’t sure what time yet. Theatre team should ring the ward once they’ve finalised scheduling, but I haven’t heard back this morning. He’s got family contact details in the chart if anyone needs to update them.\n[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks. I’ll follow up with the surgical team and confirm timing when possible.

{"text": "[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Good morning, Mr. Carter. I’m Dr. Chen from City Thoracic Unit. I’ll just get the handover from my colleague now, if that’s alright.\n[PATIENT]: Yes, that’s fine.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: This should be Bed 5, James Carter, 62 years old, under Dr. Singh — I believe he’s the thoracic surgeon on today’s roster. Mr. Carter was admitted yesterday after referral from oncology for surgical review of what appears to be a left upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma. He’s had increasing shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month — he’s not sure exactly when it started worsening. CT chest shows a 3.8 cm lesion with no definite mediastinal involvement, but margins are still being reviewed. The PET from last week shows localized uptake, though I think pathology hasn’t correlated all the findings yet.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He’s currently haemodynamically stable. No haemoptysis or chest pain reported overnight. Oxygen sats are sitting around 96% on room air. Pain’s been manageable with regular paracetamol. No major changes overnight, though he mentioned feeling “a bit tighter” this morning.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Hi Mr. Carter, can I just confirm your full name for me?\n[PATIENT]: James Carter.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, and I’ll check your wristband… that matches. Are you having any pain or discomfort at the moment?\n[PATIENT]: Just some chest tightness, not bad though.\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Vitals this morning roughly BP 132/78, HR 76, RR 18, Temp 36.9, SpO₂ 96%. I’ll double‑check the printed obs to be sure.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any allergies?\n[PATIENT]: No known allergies.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Okay, I’ll confirm that in the chart. What about current medications?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: He’s on regular paracetamol one gram QID, salbutamol inhaler as needed, pantoprazole 40 daily. No antibiotics at present — there was some discussion yesterday about prophylaxis, but decision pending surgical review. IV fluids were stopped overnight; he’s nil by mouth while waiting for the team to confirm theatre timing, which I think will depend on bed availability and the PFT results.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Any relevant medical history?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes — hypertension controlled on amlodipine 5 mg daily, former smoker, about a 30‑pack‑year history, no diabetes that I know of, and no previous thoracic surgery. Oncology mentioned possible mild COPD features, but that hasn’t been formally diagnosed.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: So, plan is MDT review today for potential lobectomy or segmentectomy, is that right?\n[OUTGOING_DOCTOR]: Yes, that’s the plan as far as I know. Pulmonary function tests are pending — I think they were booked for this morning, but not entirely sure if they’ve been collected yet. Bloods from yesterday were within normal limits — WCC 7.8, CRP 12, renal and liver fine, ECG normal sinus rhythm. No other outstanding investigations I’m aware of.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Great, thanks. Mr. Carter, anything you need before we wrap up?\n[PATIENT]: No, I’m okay. Just waiting to find out what’s happening with surgery.\n[INCOMING_DOCTOR]: Perfect.

Levetiracetam is taken twice a day, about 12 hours apart. It’s important not to miss doses. Some people feel a bit tired or moody when they first start, but that usually settles. If you feel very low or notice any big changes in mood, let us know straight away.\n[NURSE]: He’s also on a food and fluid chart while we monitor his intake—he’s been a bit nauseous since yesterday but is improving.\n[PHARMACIST]: Good to know. Daniel, you’ll also need to avoid driving for now—by law, you need to be seizure-free for a certain period before you can drive again. We’ll give you written information about that too.\n[PATIENT]: Okay. I didn’t realise that.\n[PHARMACIST]: Totally understandable. I’ll leave you with a medication info sheet and come back later to check if you have any questions. We’ll also make sure your GP and community pharmacy are updated when you’re discharged.\n[NURSE]: Thanks, Alicia. I’ll keep monitoring his neuro obs and ensure he’s tolerating the meds.
