[OUTGOING_NURSE]:Good Morning, Terry. I’m Jack from night shift. This is Evie; she’ll be looking after you today.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Hi, terry. I’ll just do bedside handover with Jack if that’s okay.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Can I confirm your details? I’ll check your wristband… Thank you. That matches the chart.

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: This is Terry Patterson, 70 years old, in Room 2, Bed 7, under Dr De Silva.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Terry came in with dementia; he’s not confused today and has been very pleasant.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s tolerated his diet well and has taken all the medications as prescribed.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: His Vital signs have been stable and there were no other problems noted overnight.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: He’s still awaiting nursing home placement. That’s all from my end.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks, Jack.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Terry, how are you feeling this morning—any pain or discomfort?
[PATIENT]: I’m feeling fine, thank you.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Great. We’ll keep your meals coming as ordered and your regular meds on time.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll continue routine observations and I’ll touch base with the team about your nursing home placement progress.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: Do you need any help with anything right now?
[PATIENT]: No, I’m okay.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Your call bell is right here within reach. Please press it if you need assistance, and we’ll check in regularly.

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: All right, that’s handover complete from me.
