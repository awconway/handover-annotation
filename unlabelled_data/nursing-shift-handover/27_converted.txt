[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Good Morning. Let's do bedside handover for Bed 3.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Hi Kelly, this is Sam, the incoming nurse who'll be looking after you today.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Hi Kelly. Is it okay if we do handover at the bedside?
[PATIENT]: Sure.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: Could you please confirm your full name and date of birth?
[PATIENT]: Kelly Diana Clarkson. 12 Jan 1990
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thank you. And any allergies?
[PATIENT]: Pollen — I get hayfever.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Okay.

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Kelly is 36 years old, and is under Dr. Mills. She was admitted with query asthma for further investigation.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Her past history includes bronchitis, and she’s recently had influenza.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s allergic to pollens, as she mentioned.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s currently on oral antibiotics.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s ambulant, self-caring, and on a general diet.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks. Any specific tests or times booked yet?
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Not yet — we are waiting further directions from Dr. Mills’ team.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: Kelly, how are you feeling right now? Any concerns you want me to know about?
[PATIENT]: I’m okay, just a bit chesty from the recent flu.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: I’ll keep an eye on your breathing and check your medication chart for the antibiotics. You’re fine to continue with the general diet.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: That’s everything from me.

[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks. Kelly, press the call bell if you need anything. I’ll be back shortly to do your observations and touch base about the plan for today.
[PATIENT]: Thanks.
