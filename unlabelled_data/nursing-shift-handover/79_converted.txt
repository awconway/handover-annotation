[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks, 

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Ian came in yesterday with severe lower back pain secondary to a urinary obstruction, he has  a long history of kidney problems. He’s still under investigation. The CT showed an obstruction of the ureters and the team are planning to put a stent in. He’s booked for a renal ultrasound on Friday at 2 p.m.

[OUTGOING_NURSE]: For pain he’s had Endone as needed and regular Panadol. Observations have been stable and remain unchanged .QADDS of zero.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Ian, how’s your pain right now?
[PATIENT]: Still there, but the tablets take the edge off.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Okay. I’ll keep on top of your regulars and let the team know if it ramps up.
