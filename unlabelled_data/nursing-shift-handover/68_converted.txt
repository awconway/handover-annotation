[INCOMING_NURSE]: Good Morning, Kate. I’m the day nurse taking over, my name is Mildred. Is it okay if we do your bedside handover with you?
[PATIENT]: Yes, that’s fine.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]:  Bed 7. This is Kate Orange, who is 41 years old, under Dr. Lee. She came in after a car accident with a skull fracture and is now one week post brain surgery. She’s much better.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Thanks. Any current concerns?
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: her Head is not swollen, and there are no signs of any bleeding, and the surgical site is healing normally, which is good. Her Observations have been stable.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Any headache, dizziness, or nausea today?
[PATIENT]: No, I feel okay.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: Antibiotics were IV yesterday; they’ve now been switched to oral and she’s continuing on orals today.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: oral antibiotics are due 1000. How’s her mobility?
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: She’s ambulant, short distances only around the ward. Self-caring with very minimal assistance.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Diet and fluids?
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: General diet, tolerating well, normal fluids.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: So the Plan for today is to continue oral antibiotics, continue neuro observations, and do the wound/skin checks. Anything else outstanding?
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: No other problems noted.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Kate, is there anything you need right now or anything you’d like us to know?
[PATIENT]: No, I’m fine. Thank you.
[INCOMING_NURSE]: Perfect. We’ll check on you regularly and help with walks. Use your call bell if you need us.
[OUTGOING_NURSE]: All yours. Thanks, Kate.
